1550312	1551003	1	1	8	Dragontoll's Secret 12	Pulao often requires herself to act like a "grown-up," but sometimes she seems to unconsciously reveal the child aspect of her when she is with the Babylonia commandant.		Affection <color=#C14F38>8</color>	
1050401	1051004	1	1	2	Starfarer's Secret 1	Nanami has planned a large number of adornments for her new frame, but because she has to travel in the data ocean, she made adjustments after Gestalt said they "take up valuable processing power."		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1050402	1051004	1	1	2	Starfarer's Secret 2	The "Three Laws of Nanami"—First Law: Nanami loves humans! So, no one is allowed to hurt humans.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1050403	1051004	1	1	3	Starfarer's Secret 3	Her frame gives her even more mobility—you can expect to find her snooping around all kinds of nooks and corners, air ducts, cardboard boxes, and undeployed machines...		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1050404	1051004	1	1	3	Starfarer's Secret 4	Nanami loves to test the limit of Power's strength. Knowing that, the Engineering Force often challenges Nanami to get Power to cut materials that are normally hard to obtain.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1050405	1051004	1	1	4	Starfarer's Secret 5	Nanami loves the elevated view she gets on top of Power, but sometimes she will get too excited and forget Babylonia's height limit, hitting her head.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1050406	1051004	1	1	4	Starfarer's Secret 6	The "Three Laws of Nanami"—Second Law: Nanami is free, so Nanami does not follow orders she doesn't like! Even if it is fate itself!		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1050407	1051004	1	1	5	Starfarer's Secret 7	System Announcement: Nanami is holding a contest for "Power's Perfect Pose", so don't forget to take a photo of them when you see them pass by! Sign up at the Gray Raven Commandant's room.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1050408	1051004	1	1	5	Starfarer's Secret 8	Nanami and Power's thoughts are linked. With just a thought, she can send Power into battle without being in the cockpit—at the expense of accuracy.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1050409	1051004	1	1	6	Starfarer's Secret 9	Power's full name is "Paradigmatic Omnipotent Weapon-Edge Remake".		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1050410	1051004	1	1	6	Starfarer's Secret 10	Power's design is based on the shape of robotic soldiers in one of the possible futures, enhanced with armaments inspired by mechs in Golden Age anime.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1050411	1051004	1	1	7	Starfarer's Secret 11	The "Three Laws of Nanami"—Third Law: Nanami must live to find the only correct answer! That is how she can stay with her beloved friends.		Affection <color=#C14F38>7</color>	
1050412	1051004	1	1	8	Starfarer's Secret 12	The "Three Laws of Nanami"—Zeroth Law: Perhaps Commandant has to choose a future without Nanami one day. Still, Nanami will continue to love humans and Commandant. This is her promise to herself.		Affection <color=#C14F38>8</color>	
1560301	1561003	1	1	2	Starveil's Secret 1	According to Haicma's calculations, the fastest runner in human history is Kuafu whose speed exceeds 1,668km/h in order to see the sun 24 hours a day.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1560302	1561003	1	1	2	Starveil's Secret 2	Back in the early days when she was free from control, Haicma was struggling to distinguish between human legends and historical facts. As a result, it often appeared to her that mankind had experienced a significant physical decline, such as a loss of the ability to shoot fireballs from their palms.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1560303	1561003	1	1	3	Starveil's Secret 3	Haicma knows a technique called "divination" in which humans foretell the future with card arrangements; however, even with all of her computing power, she cannot prove its validity.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1560304	1561003	1	1	3	Starveil's Secret 4	Haicma's old-fashioned hat was originally worn to cover up a damaged component, but she decided to keep it even after the component was mended. It has become her routine to clean and repair this hat, and the reason for it is that a gear covering her head makes her feel "secure." She values the emotional connection brought by a particular item more than its necessity.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1560305	1561003	1	1	4	Starveil's Secret 5	Haicma excels in making puns, and she will explain her puns whenever necessary. The statement "excels in making puns" is based on the fact that she has a success rate of 89% in making her listeners laugh, which is truly impressive even though more than 50% of successful cases are not due to the pun itself.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1560306	1561003	1	1	4	Starveil's Secret 6	Haicma's composed exterior can be deceiving at times because she can maintain an impassive expression even when a storm is raging in her mind.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1560307	1561003	1	1	5	Starveil's Secret 7	Haicma's thinking is the result of precise calculations. Therefore, she often feels perplexed when a situation exceeds her expectations, but this is not a kind of feeling she hates.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1560308	1561003	1	1	5	Starveil's Secret 8	At first, Haicma wielded her scythe strictly adhering to the tactical movements in her database that include many subtleties like the angles and amount of force applied; yet, she soon discovered that adding certain variations to the tactical movements could increase combat efficiency by nearly 20%... It took a long time before she recovered from such an astonishment.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1560309	1561003	1	1	6	Starveil's Secret 9	Haicma's database contains a wealth of information on domestic services, which theoretically qualifies her as an expert in child care. But when it comes to real life, she has failed a lot due to her over-reliance on those theories.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1560310	1561003	1	1	6	Starveil's Secret 10	Haicma once stood motionless in the middle of a road for an entire day just because she did not want to disturb a bird that had landed on her head.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1560311	1561003	1	1	7	Starveil's Secret 11	In addition to imitating human sleep, Haicma also tried to kick a drink can the way humans did, and the can ended up going straight through a rusty trash bin.		Affection <color=#C14F38>7</color>	
1560312	1561003	1	1	8	Starveil's Secret 12	Haicma's frame was prepared by a researcher. Because she obtained this frame without knowing it at all, she has yet to fully understand its every function. For example, she just discovered that she can pull a never-ending string of colorful flags out from the joints of her arms.		Affection <color=#C14F38>8</color>	
1070401	1071004	1	1	2	Scire's Secret 1	At the beginning of the modification, she didn't expect Kurono would accept all her outrageous demands. And as a result, the backup plan she prepared was never used.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1070402	1071004	1	1	2	Scire's Secret 2	The only design proposal rejected was the one created based on her personal preference—an Inver-Device that is twice as large as the current one. The argument was settled with Karenina's compromise, after the person showed her a scenario where the wearer had to crouch down to pass through the doorway after installing the Inver-Device.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1070403	1071004	1	1	3	Scire's Secret 3	Members of the Engineering Force can hear their captain and vice-captain arguing almost every day. Although it sounds like Karenina is winning, Teddy is also impeccable. Currently, Karenina's win-loss ratio against Teddy is 126:382.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1070404	1071004	1	1	3	Scire's Secret 4	Even in Babylonia, people like Karenina who have pursued education after becoming Constructs were very rare, not to mention that she graduated with the highest score among all students in her major.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1070405	1071004	1	1	4	Scire's Secret 5	During her study, Karenina tried learning musical instruments and eventually chose to learn the drums. Her vocal teacher at the time described the sound as "the beats that strike the soul" and soon after that, advised her to quit in a gentle manner.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1070406	1071004	1	1	4	Scire's Secret 6	To adapt to the new combat style, Karenina has to go through high-intensity zero-gravity and hyper-gravity training every day. The biggest struggle to overcome is to avoid being hit by her two ponytails in the face during the spin.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1070407	1071004	1	1	5	Scire's Secret 7	The Blast Hammer was intentionally designed to retain the capability of launching projectiles, so that Karenina can still "bring back her good old days" from time to time. As her shooting targets are usually the ruins that need to be demolished, this leisure activity of hers has actually saved a large amount of money that would otherwise be spent on demolition machinery.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1070408	1071004	1	1	5	Scire's Secret 8	Due to the slight difference between the simulated gravity on the Moon and Babylonia, Karenina often hit the ceiling for exerting too much force when she first arrived on the Moon.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1070409	1071004	1	1	6	Scire's Secret 9	When Karenina was back to Babylonia, it took her some time to get used to the simulated gravity there. She acted gently even when walking. Surprised by her overly delicate movements, members suggested her to get more rest.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1070410	1071004	1	1	6	Scire's Secret 10	For a long time, Karenina didn't understand why people kept looking at the top of her head while talking to her, until the Gray Raven Commandant explained that her Inver-Device shook back and forth when she talked.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1070411	1071004	1	1	7	Scire's Secret 11	Karenina seems to become more "candid" than before. When Bianca pointed this out with relief, Karenina explained that it was only a self-abandonment behavior because she couldn't turn off the emotional perception function of her Inver-Device.		Affection <color=#C14F38>7</color>	
1070412	1071004	1	1	8	Scire's Secret 12	Tip for getting leave approved in the Engineering Force: Leave applications have at least 30% more chance to be approved when Gray Raven's Commandant is at the Engineering Force. —Teddy		Affection <color=#C14F38>8</color>	
1570301	1571003	1	1	2	Arca's Secret 1	When he was a kid, he read a lot of mangas in the book storage room, and there were quite some weird ones among them. As a result, he can enjoy all kinds of books, especially those recommended by his comrades. He will make sure to finish them.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1570302	1571003	1	1	2	Arca's Secret 2	He once left a manga in City 075 in order to make room for supplies in his bag. While investigating the place, Gray Raven found the book, which had a pear blossom between the pages. Later, he retrieved the book, but lost it again when he was severely injured in City 210.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1570303	1571003	1	1	3	Arca's Secret 3	Noan still dreams of his past from time to time. Now he can become aware of the dream and wake up, because the clockwork firefly is always intact in the dream.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1570304	1571003	1	1	3	Arca's Secret 4	He has lost count of the skills he learned in the past in order to survive. There is one thing he isn't good at, though, which is cooking. That's because he didn't have the chance to cook before he became a Construct. Now he can make decent food as long as there is a recipe to follow. Sometimes he still tries to eat the offcut ingredients, because he thinks throwing them away is a waste.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1570305	1571003	1	1	4	Arca's Secret 5	Whenever he doesn't know what to say, he'd start to tell weird jokes with a perfectly straight face. Most of the time people think he is being serious, because he definitely looks it. Before he begins, Noan would always say "Let me tell you a secret." If the listener takes it, though, he'll start to explain. That is, if he still has the chance.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1570306	1571003	1	1	4	Arca's Secret 6	His comrades from the Cargo Crew used to say he was very good at consoling people. As a result, he was often asked to talk with others over a drink. Noan doesn't drink. He doesn't even like the smell of alcohol and tobacco. Still, he won't leave someone who needs help and company alone.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1570307	1571003	1	1	5	Arca's Secret 7	He doesn't know how to react to tears, nor can he tell if someone is faking crying. Whenever someone cries, he gets very nervous, even though he manages to maintain a straight face. He also tends to say yes to things he usually wouldn't at such times.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1570308	1571003	1	1	5	Arca's Secret 8	If there is an afterlife, Noan wants to be a seagull. Actually, he had never seen the sea or a seagull before he became a Construct.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1570309	1571003	1	1	6	Arca's Secret 9	He was known to be a stubborn kid on Commoner Carriage N before the age of thirteen. A few reckless rebellions earned him the nickname "prickly chestnut" behind his back. However, since he never had the chance to see chestnut shells or anyone getting injured from picking chestnuts, he didn't realize the nickname was meant for him at all.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1570310	1571003	1	1	6	Arca's Secret 10	Noan doesn't really have a preference for colors, but he does like things that are white and pure, like white fabrics, white feathers, clouds on a sunny day, clean paper... The only white thing he doesn't like is snow, especially a snowy field that stretches beyond the horizon.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1570311	1571003	1	1	7	Arca's Secret 11	He has a friendly personality. He used to have a lot of friends when he was a human, but only really connected with a few of them. He tends to be slow and reluctant to react to people. Most of the time he won't open up until he has known someone for a long while. He'll only want to get closer to someone when he becomes familiar with them.		Affection <color=#C14F38>7</color>	
1570312	1571003	1	1	8	Arca's Secret 12	He tells his true feelings to those who he feels close to. When he realizes that certain things he says will cause them to react in a funny way, he'd occasionally make fun of them on purpose. He is aware that he is still a kid deep inside, but he doesn't intend to pretend otherwise in front of his friends.		Affection <color=#C14F38>8</color>	
1040401	1041004	1	1	2	Stigmata's Secret 1	Because Stigmata's appearance and specifications are much different from Zero's, when Bianca first appeared before the Purifying Force in this frame, some members did not even recognize her as their captain.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1040402	1041004	1	1	2	Stigmata's Secret 2	When Bianca was appointed as the captain of the Purifying Force, most of the members were displeased. But after she "courteously" invited all members to spend one day with her in the training room, all doubts and gloom disappeared as if they had never existed.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1040403	1041004	1	1	3	Stigmata's Secret 3	Fond of reading and studying literature, Bianca once had an enthusiasm for creating a movie script sparked in her mind. However, it quickly cooled off when she could not think up a name for her movie. To this day, that ambition still resides in a little corner of her heart.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1040404	1041004	1	1	3	Stigmata's Secret 4	Chiko once said that Bianca "has ferocious aggressiveness deep within her heart." It left Bianca completely bewildered, but no matter how hard she pressed for an explanation, Chiko never revealed the reasons behind her judgment.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1040405	1041004	1	1	4	Stigmata's Secret 5	The head-mounted Inver-Device is specially devised to operate with the Phantom Tracer, which can most accurately detect and capture the Punishing Virus residuals. Although it appears to have rotatable joints, it actually cannot be rotated.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1040406	1041004	1	1	4	Stigmata's Secret 6	In order to enhance the "lamp-like" feeling, the Phantom Tracer is equipped with a lighting function. However, because Mother's tissue sealed inside will also emit an apparitional light when this function is activated, Bianca has avoided using it to prevent unnecessary anxiety.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1040407	1041004	1	1	5	Stigmata's Secret 7	Bianca's biggest interest is watching movies. There are even display cabinets in her personal dorm specifically for classic literary movie discs that she spent most of her salary on. After switching into Stigmata, she has become hooked on knight-themed fantasy movies from the Golden Age.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1040408	1041004	1	1	5	Stigmata's Secret 8	The Swordstaff was originally called "Black Excalibur" in its designer's personal file before being finalized as "Hecate". As it was too different from Bianca's style, Bianca rejected it once it was proposed.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1040409	1041004	1	1	6	Stigmata's Secret 9	Perhaps not many people noticed it, but Bianca and Chiko were actually good friends. They once went to the movies together on their day off in Babylonia, but had a big disagreement over whether to watch a romance or a spy movie.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1040410	1041004	1	1	6	Stigmata's Secret 10	Bianca was once ridiculed as a "half-baked captain" within the Purifying Force. In order to fortify Bianca's leadership, Chiko did many things with great effort behind the scenes, but the two of them never spoke about it even though Bianca was aware of what Chiko had done.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1040411	1041004	1	1	7	Stigmata's Secret 11	Karenina once strongly demanded an investigation into the structural and safety issues of the Phantom Tracer as she was concerned that it would inflict irreversible damage on Bianca's M.I.N.D. After facing repeated harsh rejections from Kurono, Bianca spent a long time reassuring Karenina not to worry about her.		Affection <color=#C14F38>7</color>	
1040412	1041004	1	1	8	Stigmata's Secret 12	Due to the different natures of the Purifying Force and the Task Force, Bianca did not share much time with the commandant of Gray Raven. Naturally, before their first Deep M.I.N.D. connection, Gray Raven's commandant was worried that their connection would be unstable, but it turned out they achieved a high and stable sync rate every time they established a Deep M.I.N.D. connection.		Affection <color=#C14F38>8</color>	
1230201	1231002	1	1	2	Vitrum's Secret 1	Bambinata used to have her hair down. But one day she woke up and naturally braided her hair in the old style.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1230202	1231002	1	1	2	Vitrum's Secret 2	Bambinata always keeps the frame clean. Except in special circumstances, she will never show up in a mess in the team preparation room.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1230203	1231002	1	1	3	Vitrum's Secret 3	Bambinata occasionally had some strange memory fragments about Vanessa in her sleep. Out of curiosity, she once kept simple notes about them in her personal terminal. But perhaps she forgot about the file, the last edit history was almost a hundred days ago.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1230204	1231002	1	1	3	Vitrum's Secret 4	Actually, Bambinata is good at noticing others' emotions but will only react to her mistress or the people her mistress cares about.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1230205	1231002	1	1	4	Vitrum's Secret 5	The storage box beside Bambinata's sleeping pod stores the "treasures" she collected over time, but she has already forgotten why she kept most of them in the first place.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1230206	1231002	1	1	4	Vitrum's Secret 6	On her way back from a mission to rescue a trapped WGAA member, Bambinata's perfect reactions to classical music were noticed by the member. After landing, the WGAA member sent ten inquiry letters in a row to the Egret Squad to ask if Bambinata's interested in joining the classical dance performance.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1230207	1231002	1	1	5	Vitrum's Secret 7	The part that looks like a "tail" on the frame is created to keep Bambinata in balance. It was originally a black globe module but was eventually modified into this soft, beautiful design at the urging of Vanessa.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1230208	1231002	1	1	5	Vitrum's Secret 8	Bambinata always thinks that her name was given by her mistress, but according to the records in her background check file, she seemed to have been given this name before being handed to Dr. Raymond.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1230209	1231002	1	1	6	Vitrum's Secret 9	Bambinata was once involved in a mission to protect a target in the Conservation Area on the surface. Nothing unexpected happened during the mission. But to everyone's surprise, Construct Bambinata seemed to be very popular among children.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1230210	1231002	1	1	6	Vitrum's Secret 10	Bambinata once received an invitation from an anonymous sender in the Little League, but she didn't go to the address in the letter.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1230211	1231002	1	1	7	Vitrum's Secret 11	Bambinata is bad at games, including rock-paper-scissors, but Vanessa enjoys having and watching Bambinata play games.		Affection <color=#C14F38>7</color>	
1230212	1231002	1	1	8	Vitrum's Secret 12	The frame prototype could be dated back to Kurono's early experiment-exclusive version, but you'll only get "invalid code" if you search with the prototype frame code. And if you search the entire batch, you'll get "non-existent batch" instead.		Affection <color=#C14F38>8</color>	
1010401	1011004	1	1	2	Hyperreal's Secret 1	There are always staff and Constructs talking about Lee's new frame, as it looks vastly different from the old one, but Lee doesn't know that they are talking about him.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1010402	1011004	1	1	2	Hyperreal's Secret 2	Lee has developed the habit of working at night as he was required to do so by his old job. A few Constructs were scared by him at night during Lee's early days in Babylonia. He was even once known as the midnight ghost in the lounge.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1010403	1011004	1	1	3	Hyperreal's Secret 3	Lee was not interested in philosophy at all. However, after switching to the Hyperreal frame, he started to read books such as The Concept of Time and Being and Time and take notes.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1010404	1011004	1	1	3	Hyperreal's Secret 4	During his rest time, Lee will adjust weapons and the exoskeleton for the Gray Raven members based on their individual preferences. This is a responsibility he is reluctant to delegate, given his past experience of a mishap where the commandant suffered dislocation due to inaccurately positioned equipment that had been repaired by someone else.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1010405	1011004	1	1	4	Hyperreal's Secret 5	Lee found some luminous parts of the Hyperreal frame redundant and attempted to cover them up. However, a researcher found it out and stopped him with the reason that these parts "can help the frame lose heat effectively."		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1010406	1011004	1	1	4	Hyperreal's Secret 6	One of Lee's hobbies is playing number games such as sudoku. Although he has invited other Gray Raven members to join him, the commandant is the only one willing to play these games "full of the fun of logical thinking" with him.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1010407	1011004	1	1	5	Hyperreal's Secret 7	Lee doesn't like to talk about the part related to Kurono in his file. Although Vera would occasionally bring it up to make fun of him, Lee can always deal with it calmly even though deep down he still feels disgusted about that experience.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1010408	1011004	1	1	5	Hyperreal's Secret 8	The Gray Raven logo on the inside of the frame's special combat coat was sprayed by Lee. No one had discovered the logo until half of the coat was modified to make it easier for Lee to gather strength.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1010409	1011004	1	1	6	Hyperreal's Secret 9	Although Lee prefers his old hair color, the coating research staff of WGAA told him that they had run out of storage of the hair of that color. Therefore, between the two options proposed by Asimov, i.e. "using the Inver-Device as a hat to cover the head" or using this hair color, Lee chose the second one.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1010410	1011004	1	1	6	Hyperreal's Secret 10	The arm of the new frame has gone through a second modification to match the new weapon. However, the modified arm can't fit in the original special combat suit. The third time Lee broke his sleeve when gathering strength from his arm, he finally lost patience and tore off the sleeve.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1010411	1011004	1	1	7	Hyperreal's Secret 11	Lee came up with an "exclusive cipher" to chat with Murray when he was little, but he hadn't been able to use it for a long time until he recently received Murray's comms that brought it back to his life again.		Affection <color=#C14F38>7</color>	
1010412	1011004	1	1	8	Hyperreal's Secret 12	Lee rarely cooks, for he will turn the kitchen into a lab by measuring everything to the milligram the minute he walks in and picks up a seasoning box. Although not good at cooking, Lee is surprisingly good at making coffee because some commandant loves drinking coffee for breakfast.		Affection <color=#C14F38>8</color>	
1090301	1091003	1	1	2	Kaleido's Secret 1	The frame keeps Ayla's favorite beret since Brilliance. She is on the "work mode" once she puts it on.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1090302	1091003	1	1	2	Kaleido's Secret 2	Ayla releases her stress by painting. She once painted 37 oil paintings, 86 sketches, and 3 120-page manga in one month—the record still stands to this day.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1090303	1091003	1	1	3	Kaleido's Secret 3	Ayla's manga creation drew the attention of several WGAA members to the potential of this art form. Soon afterward, WGAA established its own manga magazine and made Allen as its editor-in-chief. The magazine was once one of the best-selling cultural products in Babylonia.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1090304	1091003	1	1	3	Kaleido's Secret 4	Before the Beam Gunlance was adopted, the new frame was once designed to fight with three Scythes—one in each hand, and one in the CUB's alloy arm. The Science Council's weapon designers were impressed by the unique combat plan before they denied it immediately afterward.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1090305	1091003	1	1	4	Kaleido's Secret 5	A mysterious Construct named "Nanami" kept challenging Ayla in painting competitions and losing them because her paintings were judged as "a real mess" by WGAA. But Ayla feels an unspeakable sense of uniqueness that can't be measured by the traditional standards in Nanami's works.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1090306	1091003	1	1	4	Kaleido's Secret 6	Ayla has designed many coatings for Babylonia's Constructs. Her schedule is fully booked until three years later. An obsessed Support Construct once hacked into WGAA's system just to jump the line. The Construct ended up being blacklisted for life by Ayla.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1090307	1091003	1	1	5	Kaleido's Secret 7	Ayla once held free Construct art classes in Babylonia. She found many painting talents in the process but also learned about what "someone without a shred of art talent" looked like.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1090308	1091003	1	1	5	Kaleido's Secret 8	Ayla started to acquire financial knowledge after realizing her assets were growing. She bought an empty entertainment area Babylonia newly developed for the rich at the lowest price and transferred it to the Center of Basic Public Education for free to build new facilities.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1090309	1091003	1	1	6	Kaleido's Secret 9	In between archaeological missions, Ayla prints out her manga, gives them to the children in conservation areas for free, and asks for their opinions. She was once immediately surrounded by the kids eagerly requesting the next manga release after entering a conservation area.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1090310	1091003	1	1	6	Kaleido's Secret 10	The Archaeological Team held a grand farewell party for Ayla before she joined Iris Warbler. However, after they bid farewell to Ayla with tears, they saw her name again on the list of persons for an archaeological mission right the next day—as the Task Force's retinue and external technician.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1090311	1091003	1	1	7	Kaleido's Secret 11	Ayla is not a born optimist. She decided to hide her setbacks and struggles away from others just because she realized that everyone loved "Ayla's smile." This is not a disguise, because she believes that a forever happy Ayla is the ideal self she wants.		Affection <color=#C14F38>7</color>	
1090312	1091003	1	1	8	Kaleido's Secret 12	Practicing more than dozens of signatures, she's been waiting for someone special to ask for her autograph.		Affection <color=#C14F38>8</color>	
1020501	1021005	1	1	2	Crimson Weave's Secret 1	Even though Crimson Weave's related modules and materials haven't been deliberately improved, the frame's cold and embrittlement resistance seems to be better than before.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1020502	1021005	1	1	2	Crimson Weave's Secret 2	At first, she thought the energy overflowing from the frame's left eye was an eye module failure.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1020503	1021005	1	1	3	Crimson Weave's Secret 3	Lucia is happy with the high ponytail, because it's neat.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1020504	1021005	1	1	3	Crimson Weave's Secret 4	The frame can use energy to create an effect similar to the magnetic force, therefore the way it carries the weapon is more flexible than the previous frames.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1020505	1021005	1	1	4	Crimson Weave's Secret 5	As it's quick and easy for the frame to pull out the kodachi, the kodachi itself is sometimes used as a climbing pick, a can opener, a wood-carving knife, etc.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1020506	1021005	1	1	4	Crimson Weave's Secret 6	Crimson Weave can let Motorbolt use her energy in an emergency.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1020507	1021005	1	1	5	Crimson Weave's Secret 7	The metal restraints on the left arm and wrist can only provide limited support. However, anyone who mistakes it as the frame's weakness, they'll probably have to face up to a tough fight.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1020508	1021005	1	1	5	Crimson Weave's Secret 8	She suppresses the Punishing power with her own strength and concentrates it in the left arm.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1020509	1021005	1	1	6	Crimson Weave's Secret 9	No one knows when she started to love climbing mountains, especially the moment of standing on the top of the mountain after a trek.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1020510	1021005	1	1	6	Crimson Weave's Secret 10	Somehow her hair end became red. She wanted to cut it off but felt it's better to have some difference.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1020511	1021005	1	1	7	Crimson Weave's Secret 11	She realized that what happened to her and Luna was not just physical change. There were times that she wanted to talk about it with Luna but ended up deciding to just go with the flow.		Affection <color=#C14F38>7</color>	
1020512	1021005	1	1	8	Crimson Weave's Secret 12	She is not as interested in powerful pets and rivals. Perhaps because she has noticed someone who is not a pet nor a rival but can always stimulate her curiosity.		Affection <color=#C14F38>8</color>
