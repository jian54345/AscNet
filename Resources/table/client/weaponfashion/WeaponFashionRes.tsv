12020003	5	203	影打—残光	シーズンシリーズ——刀	眼前の刃は夕日が如く赤い光を放つ。ただの残材であったが特殊な加工を施して現在のような変化を起こした。刀の性能自体が変わった訳ではないものの、より鋭い刃へ変貌したことを無意識にうかがわせる。「色」というのは、そんな奇妙で素晴らしい効果を持っている。	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconToolsSp/E3SwordMd080012Sp.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/E3SwordMd080012.png			20270311									
12020004	5	204	Bonescale Blade	Ocean Secret — Katana	Do you really think mermaids have no means to protect themselves? They forge their scales into a mail and bones into a blade to defend their bodies, minds, and their important ones behind.

12030001	5	301	Caldwell - 49	Oathbound — Levi-Gun	This Levi-Gun was named after a rose in a far-off galaxy. The universe was dubbed the "ultimate romance" during the Golden Age. Of course, converting the romantic value into damage is far more gratifying. Whether it's the aesthetic or the damage rate, it's nearly flawless, except that it demands the user to have a superb aiming skill.

12030002	5	302	Platinum Swan	Advanced Production — Levi-Gun	Just like how people tend to ignore the aggressiveness of swans for their gorgeous looks, the elegant and slender shape of this Levi-Gun often makes others forget the fact that it is a weapon used by Task Force Constructs.

12040002	5	402	White Acclaim	Oathbound — Bow	As the name suggests, this is a ceremonial rather than a practical weapon. Instead of a raging battlefield, it belongs in a sacred or peaceful setting.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconToolsSp/E3BowMd100011Sp.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/E3BowMd100011.png			20470211									
12040003	5	403	Nightflyer	Spring Festival — Bow	A bow that follows the style of a traditional hunting bow both in terms of design and crafting techniques.

12040004	5	404	Elpis, Release!	Fantasy Harmony — Bow	Carrying the purest dream of the girl, the pink bow spreads its wings to shoot the arrow infused with passion and hope to the darkness before dawn. When the dawn breaks, the girl travels in the sound of discussion and sees the familiar figure. She secretly pulls the pink bowstring that not only contains the power to destroy evil but also Cupid's magic.

12060002	5	602	Star of Bethlehem	Christmas — Greatsword	A greatsword that resembles a Christmas tree. The Star of Bethlehem is stuck tightly on the tip, so tight that not even a fierce swing can shake it off. The blade is not sharp, but its bulk makes it a deadly weapon.

12060003	5	603	Oceanic Assault	Ocean Secret — Greatsword	A sword that uses a massive amount of soft filling material to cope with impact beyond the limit. Its unique design also makes it look more like a cushion than a weapon. Although the cold light reflected by the blade (the fin) makes most people drop the idea of holding it while sleeping, the fish's eyes are surprisingly mesmerizing. Even the designer ended up falling victim to it.

12060004	5	604	Shadow Blade	Spring Festival — Greatsword	A greatsword featuring a low-key dark color scheme to highlight the durability of its material.

Besides, the ribbon is surprisingly suitable for the festival that we are celebrating.

12070001	5	701	Firecrackers	Spring Festival — Cannon	Its design is inspired by firecrackers. The firecrackers on the tail can be loaded into the barrel as a projectile. It has a several second downtime after every shot.

12070003	5	703	Flame Beast	Operation Zero — Cannon	Although the user always complains that the designer misunderstood their requirements and that they want a feline beast who devours food, not a cute beast who holds a knife and fork, the user has never raised the appeal or asked for adjustment.

12080001	5	801	World Drifter	Fairy Garment — Dagger	Not joyous for external gains, not saddened for personal losses. Even if heavens crumble, become the stream that weaves through the ruins. Just like these twin daggers, undeterred by the world's change. They carry the legacy of Kowloong, enduring until the day they're needed once more.

12100001	5	1001	Dragonboat	Dragon Boat Festival — Uniframe Greatsword	A greatsword created with the theme of an ancient Dragon Boat Festival celebration ceremony. A tester complains that a sword with this design can only be an exhibit and then raises the sword, which immediately breaks the wall of the testing room.

12130001	5	1301	Starry Clouds	Spring Festival — Uniframe Glaive	"The stars have been witnessing mankind for an eternity. The human history is like ever-changing clouds." The patterns on the heavy glaive are delicate and give an antique feel. According to the Kowloong history, this glaive was once given to its owner as a gift. There is a small "Yuan" signed at the end of the letter found in the package.

12170002	5	1702	Open Annulus	New Life — Amplifier	The internal transmission loop of Open Annulus is complex and esoteric because of its avant-garde notch design. Once considered to prioritize form over function, its immense computing power has silenced its naysayers as its processing power reaches new heights from its breakthrough innovation.

12180001	5	1801	Soaker Mk.81 Redux	True Blue — Gun Set	Soaker Mk.81 was originally just a toy sold by a certain 13th consortium during the Golden Age. It is surprising that it can really be used as a weapon after Wanshi's thorough modification. Equipped with Wanshi's customized energy can filled with mint-flavored gas, it can refresh the minds of its user and the target hit when it fires. It also retains a function that a toy should have. By reducing its power output, its user can blow away sleepiness with pleasantly cool winds.

12200001	5	2001	Lion Glory	Yesterday Once More — Gunblade	Lion Glory is the name of the weapon equipped by outstanding F.O.S. graduates. Its name originates from the lion-like deep roar when it is swung. Lions are not easily tamed, and Lion's Glory is not lightly given out. Holders need to discipline themselves and engrave their hopes on their chests to be worthy of the glory of the lion's soul.

12200002	5	2002	Gray Moon Embrace	Paradise Lost — Gunblade	A weapon that cuts through the red tide as if desiring to drink all the blood of its enemies. As long as its hilt is gripped tightly, its wielder will have an endless impulse to keep moving forward no matter what has happened. But is this an eternal curse or a voluntary choice of its wielder?

12220001	5	2201	Blue Slumber	Yesterday Once More — Uniframe Chain Blade	A dreamy blue rose blooms in the palm of the knight's hand. There he stands, on the shore far across the distance, praying for the dream world to extend and the pedals to crush the confusion and lead a way for an encounter. Even if the connection is bound to be made with thorns, and despite the suffering and the pain, he will never let it go until death.

12230002	5	2302	Theros' Bloom	Beats & Beach — Banner Spear	In order to protect the maiden from the scorching light, its panels open as if a flower blooms, occupying a space exclusively for her. Maintaining a low profile, the maiden looks for something that can arouse her interest along with the flow of music, until a person meets her gaze and instantly turns away. The maiden knows it is time to use its another function. She folds the panels down and hurls it like a javelin. It pierces into the ground right before the commandant.

12240003	5	2403	Titania	Wandering Ballad — Scepter	Butterfly wings carry dreams and give off a jade-colored luminescence. As long as the traces of memory do not fade, the light of the scepter will not grow dim, and the magic of realizing dreams will last forever.

12250001	5	2501	Wind Wisher	Ephemeral Euphony — Flute Sword	As she prays, she imparts her wishes to the gods. Quietly seated in the courtyard, the girl softly plays her flute. May boundless happiness forever accompany the one she yearns for, distant and beyond her grasp. The melody of the flute intertwines with rustling leaves, and her gaze pierces through swirling snow into the mist. "Can I see you once more, even if only for a moment...?"

She makes up her mind and draws an arc with two fingers. Just when the audience is about to imitate her gesture, a red, sharp blade appears and starts dancing in sync with the girl. After a short silence, the audience bursts into cheers—Being good at singing is not the only standard for the new generation of idols.

12280001	5	2801	Rabbit Fire	Spring Festival — Blast Hammer	The first weapon released this year by the Engineering Force. With a little support from the deputy captain, it found its way to the World Government Association of Art for a fresh coat of paint. Now, it sports a "Welcoming Spring" rabbit motif, because, well, "a weapon should reflect its master." Swing it down hard, and the whoosh of air is like the booming thunder of spring. Who would have thought that it was merely a mechanical mortar for pounding rice cakes before it was modified by Karenina?
