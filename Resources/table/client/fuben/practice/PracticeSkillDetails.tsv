30100925	Anti-gravity System	Anti-gravity System: When Karenina: Scire has a set of 3-Ping Orbs or Matrix's enhanced orb effect, holding the Basic Attack button will start charging and consume 3-Ping Orbs (up to 2 sets can be consumed), each set granting 20 Anti-gravity Energy. After that, Karenina leaps up into the air with Leap Attack that deals 750% Dark DMG (its Base DMG increases by 250% if 2 sets of 3-Ping Orbs have been consumed) and activates the Anti-gravity status. In this status, tapping the Basic Attack button repeatedly will cast Radiant Whirlwind that deals 10% Dark DMG, and each Basic Attack will increase Karenina's airborne duration and spin speed. Upon landing, Gravity Overload will be triggered to deduct 20 Anti-gravity Energy in exchange for 10 Energy and deal 300% Dark DMG. If Karenina has more than 20 Anti-gravity Energy, she can leap up again until her Anti-gravity Energy becomes insufficient. Radiant Whirlwind will accumulate Kinetic Energy. Casting Starshatter Horizon in the Anti-gravity status will consume all Kinetic Energy, each increasing its Base DMG by 0.14% (up to 100%). Ending the Anti-gravity status will empty Kinetic Energy as well. When the Anti-gravity status is activated, Airborne Spin can be cast by tapping the Dodge button to pull and knock back nearby enemies, dealing 200% Dark DMG and restoring 20 Anti-gravity Energy (can be triggered once per 10s only). If the dodge triggers Matrix, Returning Repulsion will be cast to pull and knock back nearby enemies, dealing 400% Dark DMG and restoring 40 Anti-gravity Energy. Anti-gravity Matrix: When Karenina: Scire has at least a set of 3-Ping Orbs, if Matrix is triggered, holding the Basic Attack button will start charging, which will be considered to consume a set of 3-Ping Orbs.

30100936	Rising Key	After casting a 3-Ping, tap Basic Attack repeatedly to charge up the Rising Engine. When the tapping stops or goes over a certain period of time, Noan: Arca will perform [Gear-Break Combo] based on the color of Signal Orbs pinged, and its DMG will depend on the current [Gear Level]. Triggering a Combo Strike also consumes all [Rising Energy] charged to increase its DMG dealt. The [Rising Energy] consumed will be converted into [Rotational Speed]. The next time [Gear-Break Combo] is triggered, if the current [Rising Energy] exceeds [Rotational Speed], [Gear Level] will go up by 1 and the Base DMG of [Gear-Break Combo] will increase; otherwise, [Assault-Rising Combo] will be triggered instead with increased DMG dealt. Triggering [Assault-Rising Combo] will reset [Rotational Speed] and [Gear Level], and its Extra DMG Bonus will further increase at Gear Lv.3.

Performing Signature with 60 Energy will trigger Sword Form's Finishing Move and switch back to Staff Form.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFightTips/UiFightTipsJiaoxueR4Bianka.png	Character Tutorial
