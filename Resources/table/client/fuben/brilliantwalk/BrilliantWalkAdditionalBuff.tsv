1	Boiling Array	The Trailblazer will have Super Armor throughout the battle. Each connected circuit has Stability that will be reduced when the Trailblazer receives DMG or casts a Signature. When a circuit's Stability drops to 0, all the effects it provides will be lost.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconAffix/AffixIconFushe2.png
