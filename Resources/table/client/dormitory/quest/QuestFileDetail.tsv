1010001	Commission System Available Notice	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiDorm/TerminalFileBg.png	100	101	Commission System Available Notice				...Why do I have to write instructions for a system like this? Forget it. Let me have a look...\nA new commission system developed under the leadership of Babylonia to accept commissions from various resources.\nFor missions that don't require commandants onsite and can be carried out by Constructs alone, the system will automatically intercept them from the mission center and keep it in the system for commandants to dispatch Constructs to carry out the commissions...\nThe commission system is accessible via the dorm terminals. Select a commission and dispatch suitable Constructs to carry it out.\nAfter the commission is finished, Dispatch Permits will be granted for commandants to claim additional supplies...\n...Sounds good. Looks like the secret-related data can be taken cared of.

1010201	Purifying Force Member's Diary I	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiDorm/TerminalFileBg.png	100	101	Purifying Force Member's Diary I				I saw it coming a long time ago. I've been praying since the day the rumor of her defecting started spreading. I prayed for not seeing her again. However, god loves bad jokes. Attacking citizens sounds a lot like her style. I never doubt it. Lucy is always like that. She has too much of a mind of her own and never cares about what "everyone else thinks." However, everyone has to compromise to survive in this world. Everyone has a righteousness that they don't completely believe. Everyone is a sword that is being wielded by someone else. It's just who would be willing to hold a sword that is overly loyal to its own will.						
1010202	Purifying Force Member's Diary II	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiDorm/TerminalFileBg.png	100	101	Purifying Force Member's Diary II				Lucy is smart. She got into the base of the Scavengers. Looking back, I think she deliberately lured me to the nearby area for the Scavengers to find me and stall me. It was when I classified the items that I found these words on the cloth she used to distract me—"The sun finally comes out today after ten rainy days." Of course, I know that the weather, the wind, the humidity can all affect our accuracy in battle, but I think that's not what she meant. Sorry, Lucy, I don't want to figure out what you wanted to say, even though it's undeniable that I once agreed with you to some extent. We can't change who we are. You are the prey, and I'm the hunter.						
1010203	Purifying Force Member's Diary III	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiDorm/TerminalFileBg.png	100	101	Purifying Force Member's Diary III				(Most of the note is burned. One could barely make out the words on it.)\nI shot an arrow through Lucy's power core to save her from unnecessary pain. The smile was forever fixed to her face when the target's down. Yes, she was free, hunted down by her best friend. It reminded me of the words she said half-jokingly, "To die a normal death is boring. If there has to be someone to end my life, I hope you would be the one." Now, everything turned out exactly as she had expected. We had an argument about human nature—she thought it was self-destruction, while I thought it was survival. Looking back, I feel everything was predetermined, but this is not important anymore. I'm just a bit lost. Maybe because the mission to hunt down Lucy took too much time. Now that she has disappeared, who will be my next target?

1030103	Kowloong Base Reconstruction Report	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiDorm/TerminalFileBg.png	100	103	Kowloong Base Reconstruction Report		 Karenina	[Kowloong Base Reconstruction Report]	Kowloong is a city of a long history. Even the Central Purification Filter ruins shows this. Babylonia doesn't have any records about the appearance and other details about the filter.\nThe outer base's reconstruction progress has reached 70%. The construction of the outer defense equipment has started. The city has sufficient supplies and is not in need of additional support.	[Notes]	The Engineering Force has benefited a lot from the exchange and learned about some of Kowloong's construction technologies in the Golden Age. We suggest accepting similar commissions from other forces on the ground to achieve mutual benefits and success.				
2010001	A Note Torn off From a Notebook in a Hurry	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiDorm/TerminalFileBg.png	200	201	A Note Torn off From a Notebook in a Hurry				Looks like someone tore a page off from a notebook and captured their inspiration.\n\n"In the middle of the ocean lies our homeland. The drifting boat knows only of her existence. They sing a song and leave the place, carrying yet the same tune when they reach the shore."\n"She is loved by a group of ordinary men who will die willingly in her arms. The wandering travelers are at sea, but their dreams and souls still cling to her. Who will ever forget her?

2010002	The Second Half of the Note	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiDorm/TerminalFileBg.png	200	201	The Second Half of the Note				The second half of the note records a story that sounds familiar.\n'The dragon wakes up from its lair, turns around, and shouts loud at the hero.'\n'The hero faces the dragon, protecting the homeland behind him with the sword of justice and bravery.'\n'The hero says,'\n'The flowers on the continent will bloom again. The princess will return to her kingdom. And you, evil dragon, will be slaughtered by my sword.'						
2010101	Engineering Force's Complaint Form	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiDorm/TerminalFileBg.png	200	201	Engineering Force's Complaint Form				...Right, I know nothing about art. I don't understand those fancy stuff. But it was them who asked for an emergency repair! I went there in a hurry to get it fixed, and two WGAA guys jumped out and stopped me from getting to work, saying what? "This is a living form of glitch art." "You can't stop the art from happening." It took them more than half an hour to finish. When I finally got it done and got back, I got scolded by my captain! Please, do me a favor, artists. Don't write anything like "emergency repair needed" for any "glitch art" next time, okay?

I'd like to express my gratitude for your outstanding contributions to art! Nevertheless, I wish the guy sat next to me could be more outgoing. I told him several stories about some artworks along the way, but I guess he was too shy to even look at me and even pretend to be sleeping during the second half of our journey. Please tell him that I'll always be there in case he wants to know more about art, and my lounge room number is on the back!

Everything has come to an end. I used the spare time these days to talk to the doctors on the Nighter about their traditional medicine. I have to admit that it was eye-opening. In their eyes, patients are formed by the body, energy and the mind. And diagnoses are made by judging the balance of those three elements... Although I heard of this treatment method before, its delicacy and complexity are beyond my expectation. This is interesting.

The book is called Firefly, I think. I can bring it to you if you're interested, Commandant.\n\n...We're as mundane as grass. See, this is what it says in the book. "Wild grass strikes no deep roots, has no beautiful flowers and leaves, yet it imbibes dew, water and the blood and flesh of the dead, all trying to rob them of life."\n"As long as it lives, it is trampled upon and mown down, until it dies and decays."\n...But that doesn't mean wild grass is worthless.\n"You die because you lived, and you rot because you were. Dying weeds bear new lives, and while the skies might not be at their brightest now, the fire burning across the grassfield will light up the skies all the same."
