44	1021001	0	0	IDLE	Is it time to fight yet?	2000	Well, I guess I could rest a while longer.	2000	I remember the Commandant saying how comfortable slouching on a sofa is.	2000

46	1021001	0	0	IDLE	I'm sorry, Commandant...	2000	I misplaced an arm component during maintenance...	2000	I was looking for it and didn't notice you...	2000	You'll help me look for it? Well, would you mind looking over by that shelf for me...?	2000

50	1021001	0	0	IDLE	Um... That weapon?	2000	If I recall correctly, it was scrapped after the last battle.	2000	It was quite well-made... It's quite a shame.	2000

58	1021001	0	80	IDLE	Oh, isn't that my old knife?	2000	Looks like it's been turned into a piece of decoration.	2000	They say it's proof of my valor... but I was just doing my job.	2000						
59	1021001	0	80	IDLE	Oh, was there an assembly signal?	2000	Sorry. I didn't catch that...	2000	I must have unknowingly stayed here for too long... Is it because I associate this place with you?	2000						
60	1021001	0	100	IDLE	Windows? They don't matter much to Constructs.	2000	But seeing the sky must be something good.	2000	After all, isn't a blue sky what we are working towards?	2000						
61	1021001	0	100	IDLE	I spend most of my time in battles. Moments like these are few and far between.	2000	Still, I can't complain.	2000	After all, we all want to live on Earth with you.	2000

121	1031001	0	100	IDLE	There's lots of new data and items here. I need to analyze them!	2000

144	1031001	0	0	IDLE	Are you escaping from work again?	2000	It troubles me seeing you like this, Commandant...	2000	Then allow me to slack off with you together on the sofa!	2000

148	1031001	0	0	IDLE	Roger...	2000	Lucia said she's okay already, but...	2000	...Arms segments are difficult to get used to.	2000	I hope she gets used to her new arm soon!	2000

150	1031001	0	0	IDLE	What are you doing here, Commandant? Is it an operation?	2000	Ah, you came to see me?	2000	It's not that I dislike fighting... It's my profession after all...	2000	But seeing others injured or even lose their lives still hurts me...	2000	S-sorry, I don't mean to... Um... W-would you mind... patting me on the head instead?	2000		
151	1031001	0	0	IDLE	T-thanks, Commandant!	2000										
152	1031001	0	0	IDLE	...	2000	Oh! Commandant!	2000	I-I was just thinking about our medical supplies and...	2000	I know I should be resting, but it's best to be prepared.	2000	Of course... if-if you could praise me a little...	2000		
153	1031001	0	0	IDLE	I-it will mean a lot to me!	2000										
154	1031001	0	0	IDLE	These decorations are lovely. Where did you find them?	2000	But using them to decorate the dormitory...	2000	Huh? You just want to see me smile...?	2000						
155	1031001	0	0	IDLE	I... I'll try my best to smile more then, Commandant!	2000										
156	1031001	0	0	IDLE	Yesterday I found a new medical book in the database!	2000	It claimed that there are many ways to treat wounds without resorting to drugs or machinery...	2000	One of which includes the usage of affirmative body contact techniques...	2000	Such as patting someone on the head to praise or comfort them.	2000				
157	1031001	0	0	IDLE	Ah! Commandant, what are you...? T-that makes me all giddy inside somehow.	2000										
158	1031001	0	80	IDLE	I love how it feels here!	2000	There's a sort of... warmth here that I've never felt before.	2000	My past? There's nothing worth talking about!	2000	Just being here with you is more than enough for me!	2000				
159	1031001	0	80	IDLE	Trying to care for others is something that came naturally to me...	2000	Don't I get tired...? No, Constructs don't experience fatigue...	2000	But sometimes, I wonder...	2000	What is it like to have someone care for you?	2000	But I guess, I know the answer now.	2000		
160	1031001	0	100	IDLE	This place has a calming effect on my M.I.N.D.	2000	It's the perfect place to rest...	2000	If y-you... wouldn't mind...	2000	...Staying a bit longer, that would be nice too...	2000				
161	1031001	0	100	IDLE	Why do people like to watch the sunrise and sunset?	2000	I guess they enjoy the feeling of the day starting and ending like a cycle.	2000	But for me... I like it because it makes me feel more intensely alive. I can feel the passage of time more acutely.	2000						
162	1031001	0	100	IDLE	I've seen some nice room layouts before, Commandant.	2000	I think I can probably help!	2000	If nothing else, I can at least contribute some materials!	2000						
163	1031001	0	100	IDLE	Commandant, would this be of use to you?	2000	I found it while cleaning Kamui's room!	2000	I almost recycled it. But luckily I was called away...	2000

221	1011002	0	100	IDLE	Commandant, just say what you want. Don't worry, I won't tell the others.	2000										
222	1011002	0	100	IDLE	Looks like I made the right decision, staying here as you said.	2000										
223	1011002	0	100	IDLE	Just wait till this is done... and you can have it.	2000

241	1011002	0	100	IDLE	What's wrong?	2000										
242	1011002	0	0	IDLE	High-intensity functions wear down a Construct frame quickly.	2000	They also increase the abrasion rate of valuable parts.	2000	You still don't get it? Constructs also need some downtime... preferably on a bed.	2000

247	1011002	0	0	IDLE	Found it. Sorry... about... Uh, do you maybe want a little robot?	2000										
248	1011002	0	0	IDLE	Kamui is so damn loud...	2000	But now that he's part of the Gray Raven squad, I guess I'll just have to tolerate him.	2000	He never shuts up, blah blah blah...	2000

542	1061002	0	0	IDLE	Oh! Look! I know this!	2000	I heard about these things in Strike Hawk! It's called a "bed"!	2000	Is it true they sap human willpower?	2000	Hm? Can I try...?	2000				
543	1061002	0	0	IDLE	Well, anyway! I'll be battling with this tonight!	2000										
544	1061002	0	0	IDLE	We've got a while before the next battle...	2000	What can we do? How about some deep squats...?	2000	Huh? You think we should just chill out on the sofa?	2000	Sure, man!	2000				
545	1061002	0	0	IDLE	It's actually quite comfortable!	2000										
546	1061002	0	0	IDLE	That's weird... Where'd it go?	2000	AH!!! Commandant, when did you get here?	2000	Nonononono... The weapon lubricant you gave me is definitely not lost...	2000	...Okay, I'm terribly sorry... Commandant, would you mind checking over those shelves for me?	2000				
547	1061002	0	0	IDLE	Oh! Thanks, Commandant! I'll take good care of it, I promise!	2000										
548	1061002	0	0	IDLE	Why are you always talking tactics with Lee?	2000	I mean, I know he's pretty good at that stuff...	2000	But still...	2000	Fine, since you command it, I'll go and have a chat with him.	2000				
549	1061002	0	0	IDLE	We fought in the end, but at least I learned something!	2000										
550	1061002	0	0	IDLE	Hm? Can I help you, Commandant?	2000	Do exactly as you say?	2000	Widen my eyes, cup my face in my hands and... g-get down on my knees?	2000	Like this...? I feel like an animal... Wait, what are you doing?	2000	Patting my head?	2000		
551	1061002	0	0	IDLE	You mean like what humans do to dogs...?	2000										
552	1061002	0	0	IDLE	Phew! Nothing like a couple of practice bouts to get the blood pumping!	2000	Don't overdo it?	2000	Thanks for worryin', but I'm okay.	2000	Besides, how can I protect you if I don't keep improving?	2000	My kind words are rewarded? In that case, pat me on the head!	2000		
553	1061002	0	0	IDLE	I'm being totally honest! I'm not trying to impress you!	2000										
554	1061002	0	0	IDLE	Liv showed you a new healing technique? You didn't mention it to Lee yet?	2000	Fine, fine. I'm up for it!	2000	I'll give it a go!	2000	Huh? You want me to put my head where?	2000				
555	1061002	0	0	IDLE	Oh! Haha! It's a head pat! Hmm, I feel better already!	2000										
556	1061002	0	0	IDLE	I think I'm... detecting something!	2000	Oh! Ha! I knew it! It's you!	2000	What now? Were you trying to sneak up on me?	2000	Oh, I see... Okay, sure. Go right ahead!	2000	Oooh, I wonder what sneak attack you're going to use? Huh? A head pattack?	2000		
557	1061002	0	0	IDLE	Hahaha! Sure, why not? Go for it, Commandant!	2000										
558	1061002	0	80	IDLE	You can spend the day being happy or spend it being unhappy! So why not choose to be happy?!	2000	What do you mean, I definitely didn't think this up?!	2000	E-even if it didn't, I still think there's a lot of truth to it!	2000	So go on, Commandant! Gimme a smile!	2000				
559	1061002	0	80	IDLE	Constructs are supposed to keep their M.I.N.D. calm...	2000	But recent events have affected me very deeply...	2000	Ah, never mind! I'm totally fine!	2000	I just hope I have you in my M.I.N.D., so I won't keep going off track...	2000				
560	1061002	0	100	IDLE	Commandant, have you heard of a flower called sunflower?	2000	In the language of flowers, it means "to fear no hardship".	2000	When we're together, I fear no hardship.	2000						
561	1061002	0	100	IDLE	This feels completely different from the battlefield. My M.I.N.D. is real calm here!	2000	Well, there are still times when I still feel a little uneasy...	2000	I don't know how though, but since you arrived, my symptoms have completely disappeared!	2000						
562	1061002	0	100	IDLE	Commandant! Commandant!	2000	I know you could use this...	2000	I thought I had loads of them in my room, but this is all I've got left...	2000						
563	1061002	0	100	IDLE	Is something bothering you, Commandant? Perhaps I can help!	2000	Oh, this looks like something I can help with...	2000	This? You can have it if you need it!	2000

619	1071002	0	100	IDLE	...Maybe I'll stay a little longer.	2000										
620	1071002	0	100	IDLE	I'll stay awhile, but only because you asked.	2000										
621	1071002	0	100	IDLE	Does Lucia live somewhere like this? Okay then. I'll stay.	2000										
622	1071002	0	100	IDLE	If you won't go, I won't go.	2000										
623	1071002	0	100	IDLE	Who cares about resting... You're the only reason... A-ahem. Never mind.	2000										
624	1071002	0	30	IDLE	...	2000										
625	1071002	0	30	IDLE	Tsk.	2000										
626	1071002	0	30	IDLE	Step aside.	2000										
627	1071002	0	30	IDLE	Careful. You want a piece of me?	2000

635	1071002	0	80	IDLE	No, I won't sing.	2000										
636	1071002	0	80	IDLE	Yes? What?	2000										
637	1071002	0	100	IDLE	Barely.	2000										
638	1071002	0	100	IDLE	I just want to see what you're doing here.	2000										
639	1071002	0	100	IDLE	I didn't do it for you...	2000										
640	1071002	0	100	IDLE	Where are you going?	2000										
641	1071002	0	100	IDLE	Tch... I'm not going anywhere...	2000										
642	1071002	0	0	IDLE	So is this the weapon that took Lucia down?	2000	It looks... Isn't that just a human bed?	2000	Bah. Let me challenge it then!	2000						
643	1071002	0	0	IDLE	I-I-I'm not going to fall!	2000										
644	1071002	0	0	IDLE	This a sofa?	2000	Hm. I've heard of them.	2000	You can take a rest anywhere. You don't need a sofa to do it.	2000	B-but since you mentioned it, I may as well try it out.	2000				
645	1071002	0	0	IDLE	I-it's I guess, it's barely... passably... comfortable...	2000										
646	1071002	0	0	IDLE	...Argh! Where is it?!	2000	Hey, did you take my energy shot?	2000	...I, um, of course I know you humans don't need them.	2000	W-would you mind... looking over by those shelves for me?	2000				
647	1071002	0	0	IDLE	...Oh, you found it... T-thanks...	2000										
648	1071002	0	0	IDLE	I have one nemesis ... and that is Lucia.	2000	I'll defeat her one day!	2000								
649	1071002	0	0	IDLE	If I see her, I'm gonna... Kick. Her. Butt!	2000										
650	1071002	0	0	IDLE	What are you looking at me like that for?	2000	Huh? You want me to lower my head?	2000	You wanna touch the most sensitive component on my body?	2000	...Just this once.	2000				
651	1071002	0	0	IDLE	...I-I guess it's not completely terrible...	2000										
652	1071002	0	0	IDLE	...Come out.	2000	What are you doing crouching there...?	2000	Planning an ambush?	2000	Hah, come back after a few years.	2000				
653	1071002	0	0	IDLE	...But if it's just a head pat you want, you could just come out and say it...	2000										
654	1071002	0	0	IDLE	Liv showed you some healing techniques?	2000	I'm not sure how I feel about these Gray Raven guys...	2000	But if you really want to try it out on me...	2000	Huh? It's just a head pat? I should just chill?!	2000				
655	1071002	0	0	IDLE	I-I-I don't need no chillin'!!!	2000										
656	1071002	0	0	IDLE	You do these to Lucia and the others...?	2000	W-well... anything Lucia can do, I can do better!	2000	Do whatever you like. Head pats and whatever else. Knock yourself out!	2000						
657	1071002	0	0	IDLE	I'm definitely not happy in the slightest...	2000										
658	1071002	0	80	IDLE	Lucia is very strong. I must be stronger.	2000	Huh? Aren't all Constructs trying to be the strongest?	2000	Besides... You've got to be strong to protect the people you love...	2000						
659	1071002	0	80	IDLE	What? I never said I don't like it here.	2000	I've been in way harsher environments...	2000	And anyway...	2000	Ahem, so when are you leaving? Stay awhile. There's no rush!	2000				
660	1071002	0	100	IDLE	All this blabbering is really giving me a headache.	2000	Why don't I just go to my room?	2000	...No, I'm not so frail.	2000	I'll just let them keep blabbering on for a while longer.	2000				
661	1071002	0	100	IDLE	Ahah! Nothing like a good fight to get the blood pumping!	2000	You think I'm overdoing the training?	2000	Isn't that Strike Hawk kid training real hard too?	2000	You're not worried about me, are you?	2000	...D-don't worry... I'm training... and getting stronger... for y...	2000		
662	1071002	0	100	IDLE	It's just a place to rest. Is it really worth the trouble?	2000	But if you insist...	2000	Here. I think you're going to need this.	2000						
663	1071002	0	100	IDLE	You want this stuff?	2000	I don't care one way or the other.	2000	I found them on the battlefield. Thank me for this.	2000

708	1081002	0	30	IDLE	Sorry. I don't feel like talking right now.	2000										
709	1081002	0	30	IDLE	I'm tired. Let's talk later.	2000										
710	1081002	0	50	IDLE	Yeah. It's quite nice here.	2000										
711	1081002	0	50	IDLE	Forsaken HQ has lounge rooms too.	2000										
712	1081002	0	50	IDLE	We could have a chat, if you have the time.	2000										
713	1081002	0	50	IDLE	I know it's a lounge, but you still need to follow the rules.	2000										
714	1081002	0	50	IDLE	I thought I'd see something new here.	2000										
715	1081002	0	80	IDLE	Yeah. It's quite nice here.	2000										
716	1081002	0	80	IDLE	Forsaken HQ has lounge rooms too.	2000										
717	1081002	0	80	IDLE	We could have a chat, if you have the time.	2000										
718	1081002	0	80	IDLE	I know it's a lounge, but you still need to follow the rules.	2000										
719	1081002	0	100	IDLE	It's very cozy here.	2000										
720	1081002	0	100	IDLE	My M.I.N.D. hasn't felt this peaceful in a long time.	2000										
721	1081002	0	100	IDLE	I don't mind them running around here.	2000										
722	1081002	0	100	IDLE	You say the word, Commandant. If you ask me to stay, I am not going anywhere.	2000										
723	1081002	0	100	IDLE	If you were here, it would make the place better.	2000										
724	1081002	0	30	IDLE	...	2000										
725	1081002	0	30	IDLE	Tsk.	2000										
726	1081002	0	30	IDLE	Nothing.	2000

733	1081002	0	50	IDLE	=-=	2000										
734	1081002	0	80	IDLE	Just like a prayer, I'll take you there... Sorry. It's an old song.	2000										
735	1081002	0	80	IDLE	Hm? Are you looking for me?	2000										
736	1081002	0	80	IDLE	Best leave the path clear.	2000										
737	1081002	0	100	IDLE	How about a weapons rack?	2000										
738	1081002	0	100	IDLE	Impressive.	2000										
739	1081002	0	100	IDLE	Do you want to talk about it?	2000										
740	1081002	0	100	IDLE	Mind hanging out, Commandant?	2000										
741	1081002	0	100	IDLE	^_^	2000										
742	1081002	0	0	IDLE	I've seen one of these things before. It's called a "bed."	2000	Although this one looks a lot whiter and softer...	2000	It looks as white and fluffy as snowdrifts.	2000						
743	1081002	0	0	IDLE	Wow, it really is soft... I can understand the allure...	2000										
744	1081002	0	0	IDLE	There's still a while before the next battle, Commandant.	2000	Today's operation could be tough.	2000	But don't worry, we're got your back.	2000	Come, let's chill a little on the sofa.	2000				
745	1081002	0	0	IDLE	You won't get hurt, not with us at your side.	2000										
746	1081002	0	0	IDLE	Sorry, have you seen the parcel I brought from the Forsaken HQ?	2000	...I'm not accusing you of anything.	2000	I might be getting overly anxious...	2000	Could you perhaps take a look for me around those shelves?	2000				
747	1081002	0	0	IDLE	Thanks. Next time I'll try to... hold it together.	2000										
748	1081002	0	0	IDLE	Rules keep the world running. Kamui, Nanami, and Karenina all need to keep themselves in check...	2000	I just worry about the effect they are having on morale.	2000	Hm, I'd better have a word with them.	2000						
749	1081002	0	0	IDLE	But I guess they're all just overly excited to see you here.	2000										
750	1081002	0	0	IDLE	What's all this about?	2000	You want me to lower my head?	2000	Is it... a new kind of cephalic exercise?	2000						
751	1081002	0	0	IDLE	You wanna pat me on the head? I... guess?	2000										
752	1081002	0	0	IDLE	Male Constructs are usually built a little taller.	2000	Why are you stretching out your hand like that?	2000	You wanna pat my head? O-kay...?	2000						
753	1081002	0	0	IDLE	Okay... maybe next time I'll lean down to make it easier.	2000										
754	1081002	0	0	IDLE	Liv taught you some healing techniques?	2000	Liv is a highly intelligent Construct.	2000	I'm sure her methods are useful.	2000	Huh? Head pats?	2000				
755	1081002	0	0	IDLE	For some reason, my M.I.N.D. feels a lot smoother...	2000										
756	1081002	0	0	IDLE	Construct heads are highly delicate and sensitive equipment. Most Constructs won't allow people to touch them there.	2000	But I do realize...	2000	You're a special case...	2000						
757	1081002	0	0	IDLE	That's why I don't mind you touching me there.	2000										
758	1081002	0	80	IDLE	Nice floorplan, Commandant.	2000	I can see you put a lot of thought into it.	2000	People really seem to like it.	2000	Hm? Oh yes, of course I like it too.	2000				
759	1081002	0	80	IDLE	This place reminds me of Forsaken HQ...	2000	No, I don't mean in terms of function...	2000	I mean in terms of... how it feels?	2000	They both feel like home.	2000				
760	1081002	0	100	IDLE	Your commands bring the best out in me.	2000	Even here...	2000	Just say the word and I shall be your blade!	2000						
761	1081002	0	100	IDLE	I think... the biggest difference between the Forsaken HQ and here...	2000	is...	2000	Ahem... You.	2000						
762	1081002	0	100	IDLE	You need more decorations?	2000	I see. Maybe I can help?	2000	For example, would you like... this?	2000						
763	1081002	0	100	IDLE	What are you agonizing about?	2000	If it's supplies you're after...	2000	Will this do? Here, have it.	2000

810	1021002	0	50	IDLE	Will anyone ever come to the door?	2000										
811	1021002	0	50	IDLE	It's nice to rest here sometimes.	2000										
812	1021002	0	50	IDLE	I'll be able to catch up with old friends too.	2000										
813	1021002	0	50	IDLE	It's a bit like my old place... I mean, the fact that there's a bed here.	2000										
814	1021002	0	50	IDLE	My hair is designed by someone else. I don't really have a preference.	2000

844	1021002	0	0	IDLE	Is it time to fight yet?	2000	Well, I guess I could rest a while longer.	2000	I remember the Commandant saying how comfortable slouching on a sofa is.	2000						
845	1021002	0	0	IDLE	I-indeed... It's very good...	2000

850	1021002	0	0	IDLE	Um... That weapon?	2000	If I recall correctly, it was scrapped after the last battle.	2000	It was quite well-made... It's quite a shame.	2000

855	1021002	0	0	IDLE	Things are good the way they are, right?	2000										
856	1021002	0	0	IDLE	Staying here calms my M.I.N.D.	2000	After all, even machines need maintenance.	2000	It'd be even better if an understanding Commandant were here.	2000

858	1021002	0	80	IDLE	Oh, isn't that my old knife?	2000	Looks like it's been turned into a piece of decoration.	2000	They say it's proof of my valor... but I was just doing my job.	2000						
859	1021002	0	80	IDLE	Oh, was there an assembly signal?	2000	Sorry. I didn't catch that...	2000	I must have unknowingly stayed here for too long... Is it because I associate this place with you?	2000						
860	1021002	0	100	IDLE	Windows? They don't matter much to Constructs.	2000	But seeing the sky must be something good.	2000	After all, isn't a blue sky what we are working towards?	2000						
861	1021002	0	100	IDLE	I spend most of my time in battles. Moments like these are few and far between.	2000	Still, I can't complain.	2000	After all, we all want to live on Earth with you.	2000

920	1031002	0	100	IDLE	Is this warm feeling what humans call coziness?	2000										
921	1031002	0	100	IDLE	There's lots of new data and items here. I need to analyze them!	2000										
922	1031002	0	100	IDLE	You like it here? Okay. I'll be with you here for a while then.	2000

948	1031002	0	0	IDLE	Roger...	2000	Lucia said she's okay already, but...	2000	...Arms segments are difficult to get used to.	2000	I hope she gets used to her new arm soon!	2000

950	1031002	0	0	IDLE	What are you doing here, Commandant? Is it an operation?	2000	Ah, you came to see me?	2000	It's not that I dislike fighting... It's my profession after all...	2000	But seeing others injured or even lose their lives still hurts me...	2000	S-sorry, I don't mean to... Um...

952	1031002	0	0	IDLE	...	2000	Oh! Commandant!	2000	I-I was just thinking about our medical supplies and...	2000	I know I should be resting, but it's best to be prepared.	2000	Of course... if-if you could praise me a little...	2000		
953	1031002	0	0	IDLE	I-it will mean a lot to me!	2000										
954	1031002	0	0	IDLE	These decorations are lovely. Where did you find them?	2000	But using them to decorate the dormitory...	2000	Huh? You just want to see me smile...?	2000						
955	1031002	0	0	IDLE	I... I'll try my best to smile more then, Commandant!	2000										
956	1031002	0	0	IDLE	Yesterday I found a new medical book in the database!	2000	It claimed that there are many ways to treat wounds without resorting to drugs or machinery...	2000	One of which includes the usage of affirmative body contact techniques...	2000	Such as patting someone on the head to praise or comfort them.	2000				
957	1031002	0	0	IDLE	Ah! Commandant, what are you...? T-that makes me all giddy inside somehow.	2000										
958	1031002	0	80	IDLE	I love how it feels here!	2000	There's a sort of... warmth here that I've never felt before.	2000	My past? There's nothing worth talking about!	2000	Just being here with you is more than enough for me!	2000				
959	1031002	0	80	IDLE	Trying to care for others is something that came naturally to me...	2000	Don't I get tired...? No, Constructs don't experience fatigue...	2000	But sometimes, I wonder...	2000	What is it like to have someone care for you?	2000	But I guess, I know the answer now.	2000		
960	1031002	0	100	IDLE	This place has a calming effect on my M.I.N.D.	2000	It's the perfect place to rest...	2000	If y-you... wouldn't mind...	2000	...Staying a bit longer, that would be nice too...	2000				
961	1031002	0	100	IDLE	Why do people like to watch the sunrise and sunset?	2000	I guess they enjoy the feeling of the day starting and ending like a cycle.	2000	But for me... I like it because it makes me feel more intensely alive. I can feel the passage of time more acutely.	2000						
962	1031002	0	100	IDLE	I've seen some nice room layouts before, Commandant.	2000	I think I can probably help!	2000	If nothing else, I can at least contribute some materials!	2000						
963	1031002	0	100	IDLE	Commandant, would this be of use to you?	2000	I found it while cleaning Kamui's room!	2000	I almost recycled it. But luckily I was called away...	2000

1059	1061003	0	80	IDLE	Constructs are supposed to keep their M.I.N.D. calm...	2000	But recent events have affected me very deeply...	2000	Ah, never mind! I'm totally fine!	2000	I just hope I have you in my M.I.N.D., so I won't keep going off track...	2000				
1060	1061003	0	100	IDLE	Commandant, have you heard of a flower called sunflower?	2000	In the language of flowers, it means "to fear no hardship".	2000	When we're together, I fear no hardship.	2000						
1061	1061003	0	100	IDLE	This feels completely different from the battlefield. My M.I.N.D. is real calm here!	2000	Well, there are still times when I still feel a little uneasy...	2000	I don't know how though, but since you arrived, my symptoms have completely disappeared!	2000						
1062	1061003	0	100	IDLE	Commandant! Commandant!	2000	I know you could use this...	2000	I thought I had loads of them in my room, but this is all I've got left...	2000						
1063	1061003	0	100	IDLE	Is something bothering you, Commandant? Perhaps I can help!	2000	Oh, this looks like something I can help with...	2000	This? You can have it if you need it!	2000

1142	1031003	0	0	IDLE	Big fluffy quilts are another kind of medicine.	2000	They heal those wounds you cannot see.	2000	Really? May I...?	2000

1146	1031003	0	0	IDLE	(Glares)	2000	Um, Commandant...	2000	Do you happen to know where the parcel I placed here is at?	2000	N-no, I'm not suggesting that you took it...	2000	Would you mind helping me look over that shelf?	2000		
1147	1031003	0	0	IDLE	There it is! Thanks, Commandant!	2000										
1148	1031003	0	0	IDLE	Roger...	2000	Lucia said she's okay already, but...	2000	...Arms segments are difficult to get used to.	2000	I hope she gets used to her new arm soon!	2000

1150	1031003	0	0	IDLE	What are you doing here, Commandant? Is it an operation?	2000	Ah, you came to see me?	2000	It's not that I dislike fighting... It's my profession after all...	2000	But seeing others injured or even lose their lives still hurts me...	2000	S-sorry, I don't mean to... Um... W-would you mind... patting me on the head instead?	2000		
1151	1031003	0	0	IDLE	T-thanks, Commandant!	2000										
1152	1031003	0	0	IDLE	...	2000	Oh! Commandant!	2000	I-I was just thinking about our medical supplies and...	2000	I know I should be resting, but it's best to be prepared.	2000	Of course... if-if you could praise me a little...	2000		
1153	1031003	0	0	IDLE	I-it will mean a lot to me!	2000										
1154	1031003	0	0	IDLE	These decorations are lovely. Where did you find them?	2000	But using them to decorate the dormitory...	2000	Huh? You just want to see me smile...?	2000						
1155	1031003	0	0	IDLE	I... I'll try my best to smile more then, Commandant!	2000										
1156	1031003	0	0	IDLE	Yesterday I found a new medical book in the database!	2000	It claimed that there are many ways to treat wounds without resorting to drugs or machinery...	2000	One of which includes the usage of affirmative body contact techniques...	2000	Such as patting someone on the head to praise or comfort them.	2000				
1157	1031003	0	0	IDLE	Ah! Commandant, what are you...? T-that makes me all giddy inside somehow.	2000										
1158	1031003	0	80	IDLE	I love how it feels here!	2000	There's a sort of... warmth here that I've never felt before.	2000	My past? There's nothing worth talking about!	2000	Just being here with you is more than enough for me!	2000				
1159	1031003	0	80	IDLE	Trying to care for others is something that came naturally to me...	2000	Don't I get tired...? No, Constructs don't experience fatigue...	2000	But sometimes, I wonder...	2000	What is it like to have someone care for you?	2000	But I guess, I know the answer now.	2000		
1160	1031003	0	100	IDLE	This place has a calming effect on my M.I.N.D.	2000	It's the perfect place to rest...	2000	If y-you... wouldn't mind...	2000	...Staying a bit longer, that would be nice too...	2000				
1161	1031003	0	100	IDLE	Why do people like to watch the sunrise and sunset?	2000	I guess they enjoy the feeling of the day starting and ending like a cycle.	2000	But for me... I like it because it makes me feel more intensely alive. I can feel the passage of time more acutely.	2000						
1162	1031003	0	100	IDLE	I've seen some nice room layouts before, Commandant.	2000	I think I can probably help!	2000	If nothing else, I can at least contribute some materials!	2000						
1163	1031003	0	100	IDLE	Commandant, would this be of use to you?	2000	I found it while cleaning Kamui's room!	2000	I almost recycled it. But luckily I was called away...	2000

1220	1011003	0	100	IDLE	I don't dislike it here. As long as you're around, it's all good.	2000										
1221	1011003	0	100	IDLE	Commandant, just say what you want. Don't worry, I won't tell the others.	2000										
1222	1011003	0	100	IDLE	Looks like I made the right decision, staying here as you said.	2000

1242	1011003	0	0	IDLE	High-intensity functions wear down a Construct frame quickly.	2000	They also increase the abrasion rate of valuable parts.	2000	You still don't get it? Constructs also need some downtime... preferably on a bed.	2000

1246	1011003	0	0	IDLE	I can't find my precision drill. You didn't misplace it after using it, did you?	2000	I... Ahem, I know you wouldn't mess with my stuff.	2000	Huh? You're helping me find it?	2000	Well... could you check those shelves for me?	2000				
1247	1011003	0	0	IDLE	Found it. Sorry... about... Uh, do you maybe want a little robot?	2000										
1248	1011003	0	0	IDLE	Kamui is so damn loud...	2000	But now that he's part of the Gray Raven squad, I guess I'll just have to tolerate him.	2000	He never shuts up, blah blah blah...	2000						
1249	1011003	0	0	IDLE	Heh. Relax. I'm not gonna punch him or something.	2000

1252	1011003	0	0	IDLE	Huh? You looking for me?	2000	Got some questions about Constructs?	2000	Why not just go to the archives?	2000	You want to know what a male Construct's hair feels like...?	2000

1254	1011003	0	0	IDLE	You look pretty free. You finished with your operation plans?	2000	If there's something you need explaining, you can always ask me.	2000	I'll do my best to dissect it for you.	2000	Not everyone gets this kind of opportunity.	2000	Huh? A reward?	2000		
1255	1011003	0	0	IDLE	Head pats count as rewards?!	2000										
1256	1011003	0	0	IDLE	Liv taught you some healing techniques?	2000	That doesn't involve injections or machinery?	2000	You want to test it out on me?	2000	Okay. Let's see how this "head patting" thing works.	2000				
1257	1011003	0	0	IDLE	...You call that healing!? My M.I.N.D. is all hot and bothered now...	2000

1259	1011003	0	80	IDLE	Hmm, I looked over some of your old battle plans. Not bad. You have really improved.	2000	What is it? Don't you like being praised?	2000	It's like I'm praising a child...? Maybe... it's just habit...	2000	Aren't you like a child though from our standpoint?	2000				
1260	1011003	0	100	IDLE	I don't care where I live. As long as I've got a workbench for research, I'm happy.	2000	(Besides, you're here as well...)	2000	Ahem. Nothing. You must have misheard me. I didn't say anything.	2000						
1261	1011003	0	100	IDLE	Lazing around here again...?	2000	We can tell it's you even if you get the bed head of the century.	2000	...No, it's not like I scan you all the time...	2000						
1262	1011003	0	100	IDLE	Something wrong with the room arrangement?	2000	You need more decor?	2000	Oh right. I found this at Kamui's place. Is this of use?	2000						
1263	1011003	0	100	IDLE	Ah, Commandant.	2000	I had some spare parts left over from tinkering with the equipment.	2000	I took them in to be recycled and traded them in for this.	2000	You think you could find a use for it?	2000

2526	1121002	0	30	IDLE	Sigh...	2000										
2527	1121002	0	30	IDLE	I can't afford to slack.	2000										
2528	1121002	0	30	IDLE	Is that so...	2000										
2529	1121002	0	50	IDLE	I wonder if Kamui's behaving well in his missions without my supervision...	2000										
2530	1121002	0	50	IDLE	The next step...	2000										
2531	1121002	0	50	IDLE	Slightly dusty around here.	2000										
2532	1121002	0	50	IDLE	The signal is quite good here.	2000										
2533	1121002	0	50	IDLE	What is it?	2000										
2534	1121002	0	80	IDLE	It looks a little unclean over there. Let's go clean it up.	2000										
2535	1121002	0	80	IDLE	Chrome, ready to go anytime.	2000										
2536	1121002	0	80	IDLE	In good condition.	2000

2541	1121002	0	100	IDLE	Careful.	2000										
2542	1121002	0	0	IDLE	Resting every now and then will increase your work efficiency.	2000	Calculations complete. A 5 minute rest is enough for my current frame condition.	2000								
2543	1121002	0	0	IDLE	Let's set a clock, then.	2000										
2544	1121002	0	0	IDLE	Commandant, I need to confirm some of the mission details with you.	2000	There's still time. Let's sit down and talk.	2000								
2545	1121002	0	0	IDLE	...And confirmed. If you need any additional info, feel free to find me.	2000										
2546	1121002	0	0	IDLE	The wardrobe is a bit messy.	2000	I'll go clean it up.	2000

2548	1121002	0	0	IDLE	I... you...	2000	...No, it's nothing.	2000								
2549	1121002	0	0	IDLE	Ignore that.	2000										
2550	1121002	0	0	IDLE	Oh, you're here.	2000	I was reading about the battle logs.	2000	It should help with the missions to come.	2000						
2551	1121002	0	0	IDLE	I can give you a brief summary if you need to.	2000										
2552	1121002	0	0	IDLE	Oh... So this is how Kamui plays games?	2000	I'm not very good at them.	2000	So I might be quite a bit duller than the other team members.	2000						
2553	1121002	0	0	IDLE	Sorry if I bore you.	2000										
2554	1121002	0	0	IDLE	I cleaned this place this morning, but...	2000	It still feels a little bit off.	2000								
2555	1121002	0	0	IDLE	I think I'll have to clean it all again.	2000										
2556	1121002	0	0	IDLE	Patting? Is this a custom of Gray Raven?	2000	No, I have no objections to it. What should I do?	2000	A little lower?	2000						
2557	1121002	0	0	IDLE	...I see. So this is how team members communicate.	2000										
2558	1121002	0	80	IDLE	Kamui left graffiti here as well...	2000	Sorry for the troubles he caused.	2000	This is my responsibility.	2000	I will make the place clean before you leave.	2000				
2559	1121002	0	80	IDLE	How many times have I told you? You have to look after your own things.	2000	I prepared so many backpacks for you so you'd know where to find them.	2000	But you still somehow manage to lose sight of your personal items. How do I even explain to the...	2000	Ah. Commandant. You're here.	2000	Sorry, it must have been an embarrassing sight.	2000		
2560	1121002	0	100	IDLE	Leaving bangs to cover your forehead can make you look weary.	2000	That's why I don't really like leaving them down.	2000	But if you insist on seeing me like that...	2000	I can show you when we're alone.	2000				
2561	1121002	0	100	IDLE	Ah, Commandant, you're here?	2000	Shouldn't you be working?	2000	...I get it now. Please take a rest. I'll handle the rest.	2000

2616	92670	0	80	IDLE	Are you coming to see me perform today as well?	2000										
2617	92670	0	80	IDLE	This is not a pipe, Commandant.	2000

2632	92670	0	50	IDLE	Let's go for a little walk.	2000										
2633	92670	0	50	IDLE	The performance is about to start.	2000										
2634	92670	0	80	IDLE	Haha, do you think these are all illusions?	2000										
2635	92670	0	80	IDLE	Come, a little closer...	2000

2640	92670	0	100	IDLE	(Chuckles)	2000										
2641	92670	0	100	IDLE	What sort of performance do you seek?	2000										
2642	92670	0	0	IDLE	I'll be all spent if I keep performing one after another.	2000	Can you help me onto the bed?	2000								
2643	92670	0	0	IDLE	Thank you. You can lie down and rest a while too.	2000										
2644	92670	0	0	IDLE	Good work, Commandant.	2000	Would you like to see my latest performance on the sofa together?	2000								
2645	92670	0	0	IDLE	Sit here then. I'll get it ready.	2000										
2646	92670	0	0	IDLE	Where are my spare parts?	2000	Is it shelved somewhere?	2000								
2647	92670	0	0	IDLE	Thanks. What do you want in return?	2000										
2648	92670	0	0	IDLE	Phew...	2000	Oh, it's nothing. I'm just taking a deep breath.	2000								
2649	92670	0	0	IDLE	Hahaha, your reactions are priceless.	2000										
2650	92670	0	0	IDLE	Reminds me of the days performing on stage with the others.	2000	It would be nice if I could do so again...	2000

2654	92670	0	0	IDLE	My true self...?	2000	I think you might be better off not knowing...	2000								
2655	92670	0	0	IDLE	Just so you don't dream about something weird.	2000										
2656	92670	0	0	IDLE	Are you interested in my body structure?	2000	I can let you touch where you want, but...	2000	You better not touch my face.	2000						
2657	92670	0	0	IDLE	Hmm... Not half bad.	2000										
2658	92670	0	80	IDLE	When I'm not performing, I spend most of my time in a dark warehouse.	2000	So I'm pretty content with the current environment.	2000	Thanks.	2000	I'll try my best to bring you the best performance.	2000				
2659	92670	0	80	IDLE	My face can change into anyone's...	2000	Even someone you fancy, Commandant!	2000	But of course, only if you want to.	2000	Though...	2000	I might be tempted to play a little prank on you sometimes. Hehe.	2000		
2660	92670	0	100	IDLE	Commandant, how was your sleep?	2000	If you're having trouble sleeping, you can come to me.	2000	Hehe, I can grant you sweet dreams.	2000						
2661	92670	0	100	IDLE	I was cleaning the dormitory.	2000	When suddenly, Nanami asked for my help.	2000	She wanted to make the place more playful...	2000	So it's kind of a mess right now.	2000	Please wait and I'll clean it up.	2000		
2662	92670	0	100	IDLE	I met this old man when I was coming back from a performance.	2000	I bought a little gift from him for you.	2000	I hope you'll like it.	2000

2706	813000	0	30	IDLE	Would you like some coffee?	2000

2725	813000	0	30	IDLE	￣へ￣	2000										
2726	813000	0	30	IDLE	...Nothing noteworthy right now.	2000										
2727	813000	0	30	IDLE	A mere butler cannot comment on their room arrangements, Master.	2000										
2728	813000	0	30	IDLE	Please forgive me for this, Master. I have to be away.	2000										
2729	813000	0	50	IDLE	Chivalry is a blade that cuts through all evil.	2000										
2730	813000	0	50	IDLE	Now where is Miss Nanami...	2000

2741	813000	0	100	IDLE	I hope I can be of help.	2000										
2742	813000	0	0	IDLE	Can I help you with something?	2000	Huh? No... I do not require rest.	2000	But if you insist, Master...	2000						
2743	813000	0	0	IDLE	It is a strange feeling to be lying on a bed.	2000										
2744	813000	0	0	IDLE	My duty is to serve you.	2000	So please, don't hesitate to order me for anything.	2000	...If you have naught to do, Master. I can play a game of chess with you.	2000						
2745	813000	0	0	IDLE	Ah, okay. Let us sit here.	2000										
2746	813000	0	0	IDLE	Master, did you see my rapier?	2000	I think Miss Nanami has taken it while fooling around with me.	2000	Such an item may prove hazardous in Miss Nanami's hands.	2000

2751	813000	0	0	IDLE	It is a blemish upon a butler's history to fail to protect their master.	2000										
2752	813000	0	0	IDLE	Master, I wish to discuss something with you.	2000	May I apply to be on a mission with you together?	2000	Whenever I imagine you fighting in a place without me...	2000

2755	813000	0	0	IDLE	This is an established fact the moment I became a butler.	2000										
2756	813000	0	0	IDLE	Master, what do you require of me?	2000	Head pats...?	2000	Of course. Naturally. Should I kneel a little?	2000						
2757	813000	0	0	IDLE	Thank you for trusting me, Master.	2000										
2758	813000	0	80	IDLE	I just met with Miss Karenina...	2000	She invited me to spar with her.	2000	Would it be acceptable for me to acknowledge her request?	2000						
2759	813000	0	80	IDLE	As a butler, I must act according to decorum.	2000	I cannot bring shame to you because of my inappropriate behavior or attire.	2000								
2760	813000	0	100	IDLE	Master, what is the matter?	2000	I was practicing with the pointed blade.	2000	Being with Master, I've seen many different foes and different combat styles.	2000	To better support you, Master, I am honing my swordsmanship.	2000	...So that I may better protect you.	2000		
2761	813000	0	100	IDLE	...Sometimes, I also remember the peaceful days in my past.	2000	I am infinitely grateful and lucky to have such an awe-inspiring Master like you.	2000	For you, and for my past...	2000	I will go through anything to protect them.	2000				
2762	813000	0	100	IDLE	Master, I found this when I went outside.	2000	I saw this from your teammates, Master. So I brought it back.	2000	It would please me if this is of use to you.	2000	If you require more of these, please do not hesitate to contact me.	2000

2859	1000000	0	80	IDLE	Time management is vital.	2000	If you don't efficiently finish your work within the office hours...	2000	You'll have to do overtime work.	2000	Although, I guess I already get so many sudden emergencies and orders that I've been doing overtime since like, forever.	2000

2944	1021004	0	0	IDLE	Commandant, you're here.	2000	Don't worry, I'm just going over the old memory logs.	2000								
2945	1021004	0	0	IDLE	Thank you though, Commandant.	2000										
2946	1021004	0	0	IDLE	Commandant, did you see the scarves I collected?	2000	I think I left one nearby. It's a scarf for you.	2000

2948	1021004	0	0	IDLE	I'm still trying to get used to the cooling system of my frame.	2000	So the temperature might fluctuate a bit around me.	2000

2957	1021004	0	0	IDLE	How... strange. I think my frame temperature is... slightly rising.	2000										
2958	1021004	0	80	IDLE	I'm still not good enough with my jet boosters.	2000	If you have time...	2000	Do you mind practicing with me later?	2000						
2959	1021004	0	80	IDLE	Commandant, Babylonia just airdropped an energy tank.	2000	Supposedly, I can connect it to my frame and do BVR attacks.	2000	But this tank is twice the size of our HQ...	2000	How do we even bring it to a fight...?	2000				
2960	1021004	0	100	IDLE	Commandant, I think I'm more sensitive to temperature changes now with this new frame.	2000	My next dish will definitely come out great!	2000	Please look forward to it.	2000

3060	1131002	0	100	IDLE	I can introduce you to Noctis and No. 21 if the opportunity arises.	2000	But. Let me get this straight. Don't even think about trying your devious ways on them.	2000	You are mine and mine alone after all.	2000						
3061	1131002	0	100	IDLE	It's not just Cerberus that's keeping an eye on you.	2000	You'll know. Soon.	2000	Just a little forewarning.	2000	Beware of that squad.	2000				
3062	1131002	0	100	IDLE	Catch.	2000	Your share of the pickings.	2000	Save the thanks. You deserved it.	2000	If you want to thank me though... Aha, how's this?	2000

3242	1141003	0	0	IDLE	It's okay. The Forest Guard have always patrolled for long hours.	2000	But with you by my side, I feel like I'm dropping my guard too much...	2000								
3243	1141003	0	0	IDLE	Thank you. But I still can't get used to sleeping in such a soft bed.	2000	Well... It's... not bad, every now and then.	2000

3248	1141003	0	0	IDLE	Babylonia feels a lot different than what I've imagined.	2000										
3249	1141003	0	0	IDLE	Or is it just the Gray Raven?	2000										
3250	1141003	0	0	IDLE	Are there any missions to come?	2000	If possible, I'd like to go on a mission with you.	2000								
3251	1141003	0	0	IDLE	It's nice in here. But staying in the same room gets a bit dull at times.	2000

3258	1141003	0	80	IDLE	(Humming)	2000	Hm...? Ah, this is a Forest Guard song.	2000	I'm not good at singing... But this melody puts my mind at ease.	2000	Of course, I don't mind singing for you.	2000				
3259	1141003	0	80	IDLE	I want to make a wood carving for you...	2000	But every time, I carve too much of the wood away...	2000	But recently, I think I'm starting to get the hang of it.	2000	Oh... Don't worry. I'll clean up the failed carvings myself.	2000				
3260	1141003	0	100	IDLE	If it's doable, I'd like for Diana to visit this place.	2000	...Will it look like I'm showing something off to her?	2000	But I only want her to feel the same warmth.	2000	Especially with you around.	2000				
3261	1141003	0	100	IDLE	Huh? My hair...?	2000	My Forest Guard sisters helped me groom my hair. I don't mind the hairstyle too much.	2000	But, I do find people brushing my hair relaxing.	2000						
3262	1141003	0	100	IDLE	This is for you, Commandant.	2000	I found it while patrolling the Arctic lands. I think you'd like it.	2000	Ah, yes, I'm still working on my wood carving skills.	2000	One day, Commandant...	2000

4246	1121003	0	0	IDLE	If you don't need something right now, put it back in order.	2000	So you'll be able to take it out quickly again... This applies to cups, weapons, or literally anything.	2000								
4247	1121003	0	0	IDLE	That's called "preparing just in case."	2000										
4248	1121003	0	0	IDLE	"One must think of danger in times of peace." I learned it from a book.	2000	Even if we are resting, we must not let our guard down.	2000								
4249	1121003	0	0	IDLE	...Yeah. Thanks for your recognition.	2000										
4250	1121003	0	0	IDLE	It's best to keep a regular life routine.	2000	Rules are rules. They must not be easily broken...	2000	Of course... Sometimes I had to.	2000	So I set myself a punishment.	2000				
4251	1121003	0	0	IDLE	Each time I failed to do so, I told myself to lose temper on Kamui one less time. It worked really well.	2000										
4252	1121003	0	0	IDLE	Weapons are prohibited in the dormitory. It makes me a little anxious...	2000	Babylonia is a very safe place.	2000	But I still think it's necessary, just in case.	2000	For enemies always show up where you least expect them to.	2000				
4253	1121003	0	0	IDLE	Alright, time to start some imaginary training.	2000										
4254	1121003	0	0	IDLE	I just picked up someone else's archive terminal.	2000	I really wish they can be more careful...	2000	Huh? Why do I see my name on it?	2000	Pretty sure I lent it to Kamui for tactical reference...	2000

4258	1121003	0	80	IDLE	People often accused me of being "too serious"...	2000	I know it's not good.	2000	It can give people stress.	2000	Perhaps I should learn to relax a little more...	2000	Not like Kamui, of course.	2000		
4259	1121003	0	80	IDLE	Hmm? What's this book in my hand?	2000	It's a type of literature called "detective fiction."	2000	Are you interested? I'd love to talk about it...	2000	How about we start from the murderer...	2000	Oops, sorry... Spoiler alert.	2000		
4260	1121003	0	100	IDLE	Is it time for the meeting yet?	2000	Not yet... Still early.	2000	I'm just wondering if you have time for a chess game?	2000	You do? Fantastic.	2000	Finally, I can enjoy a game without having to explain its rules for 10 minutes.	2000		
4261	1121003	0	100	IDLE	Sometimes I wish I can quickly enter hibernation like Wanshi.	2000	Constructs don't necessarily need hibernation...	2000	But we still get tired.	2000	To ensure a good night's sleep... I should cut the rest and finish the work early.	2000	Ah, you're right... That defeats the entire purpose.	2000		
4262	1121003	0	100	IDLE	Commandant, please take this.	2000	Actually, I asked Celica to help me pick it. I couldn't make up my mind.	2000	Hope you will like it...	2000

4342	1221002	0	0	IDLE	I don't need rest.	2000	But I have to collect experimental data about it.	2000								
4343	1221002	0	0	IDLE	...Data collected. Is this what it means to "rest"? I still don't understand...	2000										
4344	1221002	0	0	IDLE	It's TV time.	2000	I've learned many things from the shows in this time slot.	2000	You want to join?	2000						
4345	1221002	0	0	IDLE	The "intimate" said on the show... Does it mean you and me?	2000										
4346	1221002	0	0	IDLE	You want to know where I got this cabinet door?	2000	I just wanted to open the cabinet over there.	2000								
4347	1221002	0	0	IDLE	That's how you put it back in place... Wow...	2000	So I opened it in the wrong direction... I get it now.	2000								
4348	1221002	0	0	IDLE	You're here.	2000	I'm practicing smiling.	2000								
4349	1221002	0	0	IDLE	You can be my assistant.	2000

4355	1221002	0	0	IDLE	Let's start the next round of data observation.	2000										
4356	1221002	0	0	IDLE	What is the purpose of body contact?	2000	I don't understand.	2000	Can we have some body contact?	2000						
4357	1221002	0	0	IDLE	Hmm... I seem to have understood something.	2000										
4358	1221002	0	80	IDLE	Do you want to give Buddy a new designation?	2000	I'd like to know how you choose a name.	2000								
4359	1221002	0	80	IDLE	Like this... No, like this...	2000	I'm just imitating your behavior...	2000	But it doesn't feel right.	2000	You're a really special person.	2000				
4360	1221002	0	100	IDLE	Lucia has been teaching me to cook lately.	2000	Do you want to take a bite?	2000	...Hm? Why are you holding back?	2000						
4361	1221002	0	100	IDLE	Your name is only a designation. It isn't important.	2000	You'll still be you even after changing your name.	2000	So... Wherever you go, I'll find you.	2000	...That was what aired on TV yesterday.	2000				
4362	1221002	0	100	IDLE	It's Buddy's discovery.	2000	I don't know how to use it.	2000	So I want to give it to you.	2000						
4363	1221002	0	100	IDLE	It's Buddy's discovery.	2000	I don't know how to use it.	2000	So I want to give it to you.	2000						
4401	1131003	0	10	IDLE	You, don't move.	2000										
4402	1131003	0	10	IDLE	What are you gawking at?	2000										
4403	1131003	0	10	IDLE	Hey.	2000										
4404	1131003	0	10	IDLE	Go away...	2000										
4405	1131003	0	30	IDLE	You, don't move.	2000										
4406	1131003	0	30	IDLE	What are you gawking at?	2000										
4407	1131003	0	30	IDLE	Hey.	2000

4410	1131003	0	50	IDLE	Too close...	2000										
4411	1131003	0	50	IDLE	I'll be standing by for now.	2000										
4412	1131003	0	50	IDLE	Don't you have anything else to do?	2000										
4413	1131003	0	50	IDLE	My view will be blocked if more people move in.	2000										
4414	1131003	0	50	IDLE	Be careful.	2000										
4415	1131003	0	80	IDLE	You're here... then why didn't you call me over?	2000										
4416	1131003	0	80	IDLE	Go on, bring me some fun.	2000										
4417	1131003	0	80	IDLE	Never mind. Just stay here.	2000										
4418	1131003	0	80	IDLE	Just chill out. I'm in a good mood today.	2000										
4419	1131003	0	100	IDLE	You're here... then why didn't you call me over?	2000										
4420	1131003	0	100	IDLE	Go on, bring me some fun.	2000										
4421	1131003	0	100	IDLE	Never mind. Just stay here.	2000										
4422	1131003	0	100	IDLE	Just chill out. I'm in a good mood today.	2000										
4423	1131003	0	100	IDLE	I'm not gonna move out. This place already fits my needs.	2000										
4424	1131003	0	30	IDLE	Stay out of my way.	2000										
4425	1131003	0	30	IDLE	I'll walk when I want to.	2000										
4426	1131003	0	30	IDLE	It's boring...	2000										
4427	1131003	0	30	IDLE	Stop following me, would you?	2000										
4428	1131003	0	30	IDLE	You're getting annoying...	2000										
4429	1131003	0	50	IDLE	Too close...	2000										
4430	1131003	0	50	IDLE	I'll be standing by for now.	2000

4433	1131003	0	50	IDLE	Be careful.	2000										
4434	1131003	0	80	IDLE	Hmm, where did my little "toy" go?	2000										
4435	1131003	0	80	IDLE	Imitate the way I walk? As you like.	2000										
4436	1131003	0	80	IDLE	It's not bad to take a stroll once in a while.	2000										
4437	1131003	0	100	IDLE	Hmm, where did my little "toy" go?	2000										
4438	1131003	0	100	IDLE	Imitate the way I walk? As you like.	2000

4440	1131003	0	100	IDLE	Don't tell me what I should do.	2000										
4441	1131003	0	100	IDLE	Following me won't reward you with anything.	2000										
4442	1131003	0	0	IDLE	This place's becoming noisier...	2000	What are you waiting for? Take me somewhere quieter for rest.	2000								
4443	1131003	0	0	IDLE	Finally... I can get some rest.	2000	You're allowed to be my guard when I'm sleeping.	2000								
4444	1131003	0	0	IDLE	My motto is "rest whenever you can."	2000	Otherwise, your body will be stiff when you need it to move... That sofa seems cozy enough.	2000								
4445	1131003	0	0	IDLE	Just as I thought, rest is necessary...	2000	Now I feel like I can fight all day.	2000								
4446	1131003	0	0	IDLE	You put your personal belongings into that drawer, right?	2000	Let me have a peek. Don't worry... just a peek...	2000								
4447	1131003	0	0	IDLE	...Okay, I'll take this.	2000	What's yours is also mine. It's our consensus, isn't it?	2000								
4448	1131003	0	0	IDLE	I hate liars even more than failure...	2000	So don't let me find out you've lied to me.	2000	Otherwise...	2000						
4449	1131003	0	0	IDLE	You're gonna regret it.	2000										
4450	1131003	0	0	IDLE	Can I borrow you for a minute?	2000	Don't worry. It's just a simple task.	2000	I only need you to stand over there holding a Corrupted plushie on your head...	2000	Like I said, a simple task.	2000				
4451	1131003	0	0	IDLE	But remember to stay still. I don't want my spear to pierce through your head.	2000										
4452	1131003	0	0	IDLE	When fighting the Corrupted, it's impossible to avoid casualties for humans... and for the Constructs.	2000	We used to put all of our efforts into healing the injured.	2000	But I've found a much better way than this...	2000						
4453	1131003	0	0	IDLE	It's killing every single one of the enemies before me.	2000										
4454	1131003	0	0	IDLE	Everyone's scared of me? Possibly...	2000	But I'm not interested in socializing, either.	2000	Having a strong bond with others always end up tragically.	2000						
4455	1131003	0	0	IDLE	A simple fact for me and you.	2000										
4456	1131003	0	0	IDLE	Hm? You want to touch me?	2000	Sure... Come closer.	2000	What's wrong? Chickening out?	2000						
4457	1131003	0	0	IDLE	...I never thought you'd had the guts to touch me. Impressive.	2000										
4458	1131003	0	80	IDLE	Days off? Why the sudden interest in it?	2000	Strictly speaking, Cerberus has no days off.	2000	But everything has an exception...	2000	I can try squeezing in some time if it's for you.	2000				
4459	1131003	0	80	IDLE	There are only two outcomes when you fight the Corrupted.	2000	Either you kill them or they kill you.	2000	It's not rare that you never see your roommates return to the dorm again.	2000	That's why a dorm as lively as this one is hardly seen...	2000	I guess having some noise come into your ears at times isn't bad at all.	2000		
4460	1131003	0	100	IDLE	Why are you so serious about cleanliness...	2000	This dorm is just a place for sleep. It isn't worth much of your attention.	2000	Because it's a place you come often, too? What does that have to do with me...	2000	Fine... I'll try to be neater.	2000	And tomorrow I'll make up an excuse to have No. 21 and Noctis clean up the dorm for me.	2000		
4461	1131003	0	100	IDLE	You can stay a little longer, if you don't have any missions at hand.	2000	We can talk something like... how's the Gray Raven doing lately...	2000	What's my intention? Hmm, seems I've quite underestimated your wariness.	2000	...I'm just curious how they spent their days.	2000	They might serve as a "reference" for Cerberus in a sense. That's what I only want.	2000		
4462	1131003	0	100	IDLE	Hey, I've prepared a gift for you.	2000	You like it? Hmph... Of course you do.	2000	They say if you get a gift, you must give one back in return... I'm sure you know this, do you?	2000	So, how are you going to repay me?	2000	I'm really looking forward to it.	2000		
4463	1131003	0	100	IDLE	Hey, I've prepared a gift for you.	2000	You like it? Hmph... Of course you do.	2000	They say if you get a gift, you must give one back in return... I'm sure you know this, do you?	2000	So, how are you going to repay me?	2000	I'm really looking forward to it.	2000		
4501	1541003	0	10	IDLE	It doesn't seem like it needs cleaning up.	2000										
4502	1541003	0	10	IDLE	Don't we have any interesting performances?	2000										
4503	1541003	0	10	IDLE	I always seek to start a quarrel with someone when I'm bored. It never let me down.	2000

4509	1541003	0	30	IDLE	You wanna stay with me today? Yeah, I'm thrilled. Really.	2000										
4510	1541003	0	50	IDLE	Oh! Roland. Why are you Roland?	2000										
4511	1541003	0	50	IDLE	What I'm saying is a lie.	2000										
4512	1541003	0	50	IDLE	Suppose a hundred Bio-Kangaroos invade here, then each of us will have to fight...	2000

4516	1541003	0	80	IDLE	You always look down at me. Don't you wanna try it from another angle?	2000										
4517	1541003	0	80	IDLE	Have you ever wondered if the world you're living in is real?	2000										
4518	1541003	0	80	IDLE	Siempre se oia con voz muy fina?	2000

4543	1541003	0	0	IDLE	Ha... It feels soft.	2000	That's weird. I've got used to the floor, and now I can't fall asleep on a real bed.	2000								
4544	1541003	0	0	IDLE	I'm bored. Let's slack off on the sofa for a bit.	2000	Relax. I promise I'll behave.	2000

4546	1541003	0	0	IDLE	Let me guess what is in the closet.	2000	A skeleton or a black hole that could reveals the truth of everything?	2000								
4547	1541003	0	0	IDLE	Haha, of course, nothing.	2000	Then, should I put something in it?	2000

4550	1541003	0	0	IDLE	I remembered that I put a timed bomb here. Where did it go?	2000	"Oh, it's here. The timer is still working. Let me see, 1351, 1352, 1353, 1354..."	2000	Wait! Why is the number going up?	2000						
4551	1541003	0	0	IDLE	This way you'll never know when the bomb is gonna blow up, which is more interesting. Don't you think so?	2000										
4552	1541003	0	0	IDLE	I know a bit of every language in the world.	2000	Wanna know how to say 'love' in Spanish? Get closer...	2000

4557	1541003	0	0	IDLE	HFF... Feels good and unique at the same time.	2000	A person who should have stayed away from danger happened to meet someone who is willing to get close.	2000	And this person is willing to touch him so gently. So unique.	2000						
4558	1541003	0	80	IDLE	Do you love playing games? I'm available anytime.	2000	How about the Pokkemon series? I used to be a master of the game.	2000	Just used to be.	2000						
4559	1541003	0	80	IDLE	I suddenly feel like doing a stage play.	2000	I'll be the director and the scriptwriter. As for the performers, let's us these plush toys I just made.	2000	Hmm. It seems we still need one person.	2000	Wanna play a part in my play?	2000				
4560	1541003	0	100	IDLE	Alright, kids! Now me, Roland, will teach you how to commit fraud.	2000	Do you know that it's actually pretty easy to completely fool a person?	2000	Fabricate information, set up the scenario, and fake the contacts.	2000	As long as you plan everything carefully, you can tell a big lie easily.	2000	... Therefore, don't be short-sighted and question yourself more.	2000		
4561	1541003	0	100	IDLE	Sitting in a room like this, eating tasteless snacks, and watching boring shows.	2000	Laughing along with the canned laughter, and yawning along with the tear-jerking scenes.	2000	Boring daily life, not dramatic at all.	2000	These are all that I expected.	2000	Now?

5359	1041004	0	80	IDLE	The WGAA appears to be very interested in this frame.	2000	They wanted to give me a new hairstyle, but I turned them down.	2000	Some of them were even shouting something.	2000	What's going on with them...	2000				
5360	1041004	0	100	IDLE	Probably because of this frame...

5431	1231002	0	50	IDLE	And the order is... to take a walk?	2000										
5432	1231002	0	50	IDLE	(。。 )...	2000										
5433	1231002	0	50	IDLE	Sob...	2000										
5434	1231002	0	80	IDLE	You think Bambinata... is cute?	2000										
5435	1231002	0	80	IDLE	Bambinata feels like dancing somehow...	2000										
5436	1231002	0	80	IDLE	Phew?	2000										
5437	1231002	0	100	IDLE	You think Bambinata... is cute?	2000										
5438	1231002	0	100	IDLE	Bambinata feels like dancing somehow...	2000										
5439	1231002	0	100	IDLE	Phew?	2000										
5440	1231002	0	100	IDLE	Mm...? Mh-hm.	2000										
5441	1231002	0	100	IDLE	Would like to dance with Bambinata, Commandant?	2000										
5442	1231002	0	0	IDLE	This bed... is different from Bambinata's.	2000	This one is softer...	2000	Hmm? You mean Bambinata can try this?	2000						
5443	1231002	0	0	IDLE	It feels like sleeping on the clouds... Ha... Mm...	2000										
5444	1231002	0	0	IDLE	Frame adjustment completed. Ready for a new order, Commandant.	2000	And the new order is... to stand by on the sofa?	2000								
5445	1231002	0	0	IDLE	Do you mean to stand by like this? How does Bambinata feel?	2000	Bambinata feels... calm. Is that because Bambinata is close to Commandant?	2000								
5446	1231002	0	0	IDLE	Whew... Huh? Why standing in front of the shelf for so long?	2000	Ngh... Bambinata wants to get the box on the shelf...	2000								
5447	1231002	0	0	IDLE	Huh? Just like that...? Thank you, Commandant...	2000	Mm... Bambinata wants to put the gifts from Commandant in it too.	2000	Bambinata will put Commandant's name here, so they won't disappear this time...	2000						
5448	1231002	0	0	IDLE	Hmm...	2000	Huh? What is Bambinata singing?	2000								
5449	1231002	0	0	IDLE	Bambinata is not sure... Would you like Bambinata to sing it again, Commandant?	2000	Spending time with Commandant like this... Hmm...	2000								
5450	1231002	0	0	IDLE	...Ah, sorry. Bambinata almost forgot today's routine training.	2000	Huh? Today's got special training?	2000								
5451	1231002	0	0	IDLE	...And the theme of the special training is... slacking off? B-but Bambinata has never done any training like this...	2000	...So what should we slack off on? Searching for targets...	2000								
5452	1231002	0	0	IDLE	?! What? That's not what you meant? Sorry... Commandant...	2000	This is the dessert for today, Commandant.	2000								
5453	1231002	0	0	IDLE	...You want Bambinata to join you, Commandant?	2000	Bambinata got it.	2000								
5454	1231002	0	0	IDLE	Ugh... Sorry. Bambinata didn't mean to knock over the vase.	2000	Bambinata was trying to take it down and put some new flowers in it...	2000								
5455	1231002	0	0	IDLE	Hmm... You don't blame Bambinata?	2000	R-really...? Okay... Bambinata got it...	2000								
5456	1231002	0	0	IDLE	Commandant? Is there dust on Bambinata's head?	2000	Bambinata... can't see it.	2000								
5457	1231002	0	0	IDLE	Yes... Thank you, Commandant.	2000										
5458	1231002	0	80	IDLE	Commandant usually leans here, right? Hmm...	2000	Bambinata is wondering how it feels to lean here...	2000	Hmm... It feels quite reassuring.	2000						
5459	1231002	0	80	IDLE	Σ( ° △ °|||)︴! Commandant noticed it?!	2000	Commandant, Bambinata was just...	2000	Just standing here and looking at you...	2000						
5460	1231002	0	100	IDLE	...Loosen the braids? Bambinata can't do that...	2000	W-what...? Commandant can help Bambinata?	2000	Ngh...	2000	Understood... Here, Commandant...	2000				
5461	1231002	0	100	IDLE	Exhausted? Do you need some rest, Commandant?	2000	Just lean on Bambinata.	2000	Bambinata can adjust the frame temperature to a comfortable level.	2000	Okay... Is this temperature okay for you, Commandant?	2000				
5462	1231002	0	100	IDLE	Because Commandant gave Bambinata many gifts...	2000	Bambinata took it as an action of love from Commandant.	2000	So, please take this, Commandant.	2000	Umm... Bambinata h-hopes you'll like it, Commandant.	2000				
5463	1231002	0	100	IDLE	Because Commandant gave Bambinata many gifts...	2000	Bambinata took it as an action of love from Commandant.	2000	So, please take this, Commandant.	2000	Umm... Bambinata h-hopes you'll like it, Commandant.	2000				
5501	1011004	0	10	IDLE	Time feels so slow here...	2000										
5502	1011004	0	10	IDLE	Maybe we should look somewhere else.	2000										
5503	1011004	0	10	IDLE	Let's talk about it later.	2000										
5504	1011004	0	10	IDLE	What was the conclusion again...?	2000										
5505	1011004	0	30	IDLE	Do we have to waste our time here?	2000										
5506	1011004	0	30	IDLE	Have you checked the schedule for today?	2000										
5507	1011004	0	30	IDLE	This might be a good place to tune my equipment.	2000										
5508	1011004	0	30	IDLE	At least... We're not wasting our time away.	2000										
5509	1011004	0	30	IDLE	Have we got any mission? We'd better get ready as soon as possible.	2000										
5510	1011004	0	50	IDLE	It's a good place to do some thinking.	2000										
5511	1011004	0	50	IDLE	Have you checked the schedule for today?	2000										
5512	1011004	0	50	IDLE	This might be a good place to tune my equipment.	2000										
5513	1011004	0	50	IDLE	At least... We're not wasting our time away.	2000										
5514	1011004	0	50	IDLE	Have we got any mission? We'd better get ready as soon as possible.	2000										
5515	1011004	0	80	IDLE	Alright. Go and have some rest. Now.	2000										
5516	1011004	0	80	IDLE	Time seems to fly by fast here.	2000										
5517	1011004	0	80	IDLE	You don't have to act like that. You won't disturb me.	2000										
5518	1011004	0	80	IDLE	I'll always be on watch here.	2000										
5519	1011004	0	100	IDLE	Alright. Go and have some rest. Now.	2000										
5520	1011004	0	100	IDLE	Time seems to fly by fast here.	2000										
5521	1011004	0	100	IDLE	You don't have to act like that. You won't disturb me.	2000										
5522	1011004	0	100	IDLE	I'll always be on watch here.	2000										
5523	1011004	0	100	IDLE	You seems to have something on your mind. What is it?	2000										
5524	1011004	0	30	IDLE	Time never stops...	2000										
5525	1011004	0	30	IDLE	That's it.	2000										
5526	1011004	0	30	IDLE	I can't... concentrate.	2000										
5527	1011004	0	30	IDLE	Where did my gun set go?	2000										
5528	1011004	0	30	IDLE	I can't waste my time like this.	2000										
5529	1011004	0	50	IDLE	On to the next task...	2000										
5530	1011004	0	50	IDLE	Huh?	2000										
5531	1011004	0	50	IDLE	What you said makes sense...	2000										
5532	1011004	0	50	IDLE	It would be better to have a linear accelerator here.	2000										
5533	1011004	0	50	IDLE	The next divergence point is...	2000										
5534	1011004	0	80	IDLE	Perfect... Q.E.D.	2000										
5535	1011004	0	80	IDLE	Hmm... Right.	2000										
5536	1011004	0	80	IDLE	You need anything?	2000										
5537	1011004	0	100	IDLE	Perfect... Q.E.D.	2000										
5538	1011004	0	100	IDLE	Hmm... Right.	2000										
5539	1011004	0	100	IDLE	You need anything?	2000										
5540	1011004	0	100	IDLE	Same to the calculation result.	2000										
5541	1011004	0	100	IDLE	Leave it to me.	2000										
5542	1011004	0	0	IDLE	Whew... Let's have some rest.	2000	I set the alarm. It won't take too long.	2000								
5543	1011004	0	0	IDLE	Feel free to wake me up if you need anything.	2000										
5544	1011004	0	0	IDLE	Are you looking for me? Okay.	2000	Have a seat. Don't just stand there.	2000								
5545	1011004	0	0	IDLE	Why not try another way?	2000	Reductio ad absurdum? Or enumeration? Hmm... Both don't work?	2000								
5546	1011004	0	0	IDLE	Your equipment from the last mission has all been repaired.	2000										
5547	1011004	0	0	IDLE	Here. Give it a try.	2000	Careful. Don't break it again.	2000	Hah... Come straight to me if anything goes wrong next time.	2000						
5548	1011004	0	0	IDLE	It always gets noisy when there are too many people.	2000										
5549	1011004	0	0	IDLE	It's just right here. No more, no less.	2000										
5550	1011004	0	0	IDLE	If you are bored with little to do...	2000	Perhaps we could do some thought experiments together.	2000								
5551	1011004	0	0	IDLE	This is also an exercise for the mind, right?	2000	I find it interesting just having a simple chat.	2000								
5552	1011004	0	0	IDLE	You mean this?	2000	Liv gave it to me. You could squeeze it to relieve your stress.	2000								
5553	1011004	0	0	IDLE	You want it? Well... Actually, you probably need it more than I do.	2000	Right. Don't squeeze it too hard. Otherwise, it will make strange noises.	2000								
5554	1011004	0	0	IDLE	...I've noted your question down.	2000	Perhaps I made a mistake during the modification.	2000								
5555	1011004	0	0	IDLE	Huh? You didn't mean it...? You...	2000										
5556	1011004	0	0	IDLE	Huh? Me?	2000	Why did you come up with that all of a sudden...? I don't understand.	2000	Never mind. I won't lose anything.	2000						
5557	1011004	0	0	IDLE	(Cough...) It's fine... That's it?	2000										
5558	1011004	0	80	IDLE	Huh? Sorry, I didn't notice you were here.	2000	I was just thinking about a question.	2000	Nah. I already found the solution when you walked in.	2000	By the way, you don't have to knock next time you come here.	2000				
5559	1011004	0	80	IDLE	Plenty of time means plenty of options.	2000	And the earlier you finish your work, the more time you make.	2000	But overwork is not a virtue.	2000	Remember, you are not alone.	2000				
5560	1011004	0	100	IDLE	It's better not to play with dangerous matters such as... time.	2000	Calculating the future and going back to the past both mean that you have lost patience for the present.	2000	Yet the present will be the past that determines the future, and was once the future determined by the past.	2000	For example... The fact that we are chatting here.	2000	That's what matters the most.	2000		
5561	1011004	0	100	IDLE	It's always good to keep your weapon system at their best.	2000	After all, no one knows what will happen next...	2000	I can't drop my guard.	2000	Especially when you're here.	2000				
5562	1011004	0	100	IDLE	Here. Take it.	2000	It's not a big deal.	2000	Take care of it. You will... right?	2000						
5563	1011004	0	100	IDLE	Here. Take it.	2000	It's not a big deal.	2000	Take care of it. You will... right?	2000						
5601	1091003	0	10	IDLE	...Thirty sketches to go...	2000										
5602	1091003	0	10	IDLE	Flip side to side... It seems tilted again...	2000										
5603	1091003	0	10	IDLE	Tracking signals... No response...	2000

5607	1091003	0	30	IDLE	There's still a long time before my next mission.	2000										
5608	1091003	0	30	IDLE	...New interview? I want to stay here a little longer!	2000										
5609	1091003	0	30	IDLE	Is this color scheme too plain?	2000										
5610	1091003	0	50	IDLE	Hmm. Turns out this is your style, Commandant...	2000										
5611	1091003	0	50	IDLE	Shh— Let me finish it.	2000

5616	1091003	0	80	IDLE	This color scheme... Yeah, yeah, that's it!	2000										
5617	1091003	0	80	IDLE	Ta-da! Attention!	2000										
5618	1091003	0	80	IDLE	Hmm... Is it upside down?	2000										
5619	1091003	0	100	IDLE	You're back—!	2000

5625	1091003	0	30	IDLE	I've got many things to do...	2000										
5626	1091003	0	30	IDLE	Are the clothes a bit tight?	2000										
5627	1091003	0	30	IDLE	Hmm. My creative juice has stopped flowing.	2000										
5628	1091003	0	30	IDLE	...	2000										
5629	1091003	0	50	IDLE	Nostalgic, isn't it?	2000										
5630	1091003	0	50	IDLE	Where is Selena...?	2000										
5631	1091003	0	50	IDLE	Wanna go with me and paint outside?	2000										
5632	1091003	0	50	IDLE	Hey! Mind your step! You knocked the paint can over!	2000										
5633	1091003	0	50	IDLE	?~?	2000										
5634	1091003	0	80	IDLE	Don't eat it! That's for still life painting!	2000										
5635	1091003	0	80	IDLE	Shh... Don't let my manager know that I'm here, Commandant!	2000										
5636	1091003	0	80	IDLE	Phew... I feel so relaxed. I want to stay here forever.	2000										
5637	1091003	0	100	IDLE	Don't eat it! That's for still life painting!	2000

5642	1091003	0	0	IDLE	Sigh... I've been working the entire week... My head is gonna explode...	2000	...Commandant? I'm fine. I can still paint...	2000								
5643	1091003	0	0	IDLE	Aww... Thank you, Commandant. Then I'll have a little rest...	2000	Don't go after I fall asleep... Zzz...	2000								
5644	1091003	0	0	IDLE	Sit straight for tight deadlines.	2000	Otherwise, you'll have a hard time.	2000	Come, let Ayla tell you her special trick to sit a long time!	2000						
5645	1091003	0	0	IDLE	Like this... Wanna give it a go, Commandant?	2000	It's fine to get closer!	2000

5653	1091003	0	0	IDLE	This is how it should look like after the repair is completed. Isn't it beautiful?	2000	The actual scenery is more magnificent!	2000								
5654	1091003	0	0	IDLE	Let's go and have a look together in the future.	2000	What do you do during your time off, Commandant?	2000								
5655	1091003	0	0	IDLE	Ayla wants to do the same!	2000	Ayla wants to try different lifestyles sometimes.	2000								
5656	1091003	0	0	IDLE	Huh?! Do I get color on my hair?	2000	Oh, you just wanted to pat me on my head? Mmm... Fine...	2000	Go ahead. Pat me to your heart's content.	2000						
5657	1091003	0	0	IDLE	Your hands feel so warm, Commandant... Now, it's my turn!	2000										
5658	1091003	0	80	IDLE	See, hold the carving knife like this...	2000	Be gentle at first. Otherwise, it will slip... Ah! Watch your hand!	2000	Umm... Let me hold your hand to show you, Commandant.	2000						
5659	1091003	0	80	IDLE	Commandant!	2000	Ayla has gotten the VR device here!	2000	It has many rare sceneries on Earth.	2000	Let's start a journey within doors!	2000				
5660	1091003	0	100	IDLE	Commandant!	2000	Is there any design you like among the ones Ayla sent you?	2000	It's boring to wear the same clothes all the time.	2000	As your stylist, Commandant, it's my job to...	2000	Huh? When did happen?	2000	Hmm— From now on!	2000
5661	1091003	0	100	IDLE	It seems you've looking at Ayla this whole time.	2000	Do I have something on my face?	2000	What? The paint...?!	2000	Hey... Why didn't you tell me earlier?	2000
