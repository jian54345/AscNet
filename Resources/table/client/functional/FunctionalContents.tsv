1	101	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, please allow me to remind you that each operation is accompanied by a variety of missions.		2				
2	101	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	After completing the mission, you will receive a large number of supplies. Please make sure that you collect them in time.		3				
3	101	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	This will help us acquire advanced equipment earlier, which will be useful in future operations.		4				
4	101	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Let us do so next.						
5	102	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, thanks to everyone's hard work, I can finally rejoin the fight!		6				
6	102	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Before that, please upgrade and tune me, then assign the battle position for me.		7				
7	102	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant... I can't wait to fight alongside with everyone together.						
8	103	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Commandant, we Constructs will become more proficient as we fight in more battles.		9				
9	103	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Please level me up to further unleash my strength.		10				
10	103	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Please pay attention to my performance in the next battle.						
11	104	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Hello there, Commandant of Gray Ravens. I'm Celica, Secretary of the Babylonia Parliament.		12				
12	104	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Please allow me to quickly bring you up to speed.		13				
13	104	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Beginner missions have now been set for all first-timer squads in this operation. Squads can earn extra supplies by completing these goals.		14				
14	104	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	It's time to prepare for the sortie!						
15	105	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Commandant. The Constructs have their own military ranks.		16				
16	105	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	It not only symbolizes honor, but raising their ranks will also increase their performance.		17				
17	105	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Complete specific missions to promote a Construct.		18				
18	105	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	I look forward to bringing honor to the team, Commandant.						
19	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, battles can be long and difficult. In return for your daily efforts...		20				
20	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Signing in will earn you supplies every day! They will help you in your journey.		21				
21	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	The supply center has prepared a special weapon for you as your first sign-in reward.		22				
22	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Gray Raven will always be with you, Commandant!						
23	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Commandant, you should have your own mission board, right?		24				
24	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	In addition to your main missions, there are daily missions that can be completed for that day.		25				
25	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Don't underestimate these mission rewards!		26				
26	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Now, let's take a look at the mission board.						
27	3	1	???	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Hello, Commandant of the Gray Raven squad!		28				
28	3	1	???	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Who am I? Don't you worry about that. We'll meet soon.		29				
29	3	1	???	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Now, I know what you're thinking...		30				
30	3	1	???	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	You want more Constructs to join your squad, right?		31				
31	3	1	???	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	The supply center has prepared R&D Tickets for you. Go to claim them!						
32	111	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	As battles get more difficult, we need to ensure a steady flow of supplies.		33				
33	111	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Keep it up and complete your major missions.		34				
34	111	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	This will ensure that we have enough resources as our enemies get tougher.		35				
35	111	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Let's strive for humanity together, Commandant.						
36	106	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Outside of main missions, you can also have your Constructs take part in training programs.		37				
37	106	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Training allows us to gain experience in simulation battles.		38				
38	106	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Please remember to schedule training sessions for us in the future.						
39	4	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	A new support squad has arrived in the region, Commandant. They are eager to meet with you.		40				
40	4	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	In addition to delivering supplies, they will also trade resources with you.		41				
41	4	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Let's try trading something with them.						
42	5	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Hello, Commandant! How are you getting along with the Constructs of Gray Raven?		43				
43	5	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Still getting used to the battle mechanics?		44				
44	5	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Don't worry, I have some tutorials that can help you out.		45				
45	5	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	You are also welcome to participate in various challenges.		46				
46	5	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Please make use of them to master the battle mechanics!						
47	107	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, are you running into skill point shortage issues when trying to upgrade Construct skills?		48				
48	107	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Battle Exercises are a great way to get more skill points.		49				
49	107	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Try it out if you need them.						
50	108	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	These cogs contain an important material used in our Construct frames.		51				
51	108	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	A lot of cogs are required to extract enough materials to upgrade our frames.		52				
52	108	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Cogs can be found in many places, especially in Cogs Galore.						
53	6	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Commandant, our equipment are made from special materials.		54				
54	6	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Upgrading them requires the same special materials.		55				
55	6	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	We can find these upgrade materials from Logistics Maintenance.						
56	7	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Commandant, equipment eventually reaches a point where they can no longer be upgraded.		57				
57	7	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Overclock materials are required to enhance them further.		58				
58	7	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	This will allow you to enhance equipment to a higher level.		59				
59	7	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	You can get Overclock materials from Military Hardware.						
60	8	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	Looks like you're ready to move past basic battle operations.		61				
61	8	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	I've seen many outstanding commandants rise through the ranks, and I see the makings of one in you.		62				
62	8	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	You can improve yourself by taking on these challenges.		63				
63	8	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	Hang in there a little longer, so that it can generate more data.						
64	9	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Commandant, do you remember the battles that you participated in?		65				
65	9	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	You usually only get to see one side of the story.		66				
66	9	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Over time, however, records from other sources become available.		67				
67	9	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Essentially, you have the chance to observe what happened from another perspective.		68				
68	9	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	So, let's trying replaying the past, shall we?						
69	109	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Once we're familiar with the tactics of a particular operation...		70				
70	109	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	The risk of battling becomes greatly reduced. This enables the Auto Clear feature.		71				
71	109	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	This allows us to complete familiar missions without the need of your command.		72				
72	109	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	This way, you'll be able to focus your attention on more important missions.						
73	10	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	High-rank Memories are important to improving the combative capabilities of a Construct.		74				
74	10	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	The more difficult the Combat Supply mission, the higher the chance to get high-rank Memories.		75				
75	10	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Now, let's try more difficult missions to test the limits of the squad!						
76	11	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Greetings, Commandant of the Gray Raven squad!		77				
77	11	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Curious about me?		78				
78	11	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	We all have our own personal files.		79				
79	11	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	You may learn a thing or two about us Constructs when you look through them!						
80	112	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	We meet again, Commandant of Gray Raven.		81				
81	112	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Have you noticed that you now have access to the Trial Zone?		82				
82	112	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	The Trial Zone offers the opportunity to try out various prototype projects under development...		83				
83	112	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	... or, depending on the perspective, practical tricks by the research team.						
84	12	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	More and more Constructs have joined our team.		85				
85	12	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	You can view your Construct roster and status on the Construct Army page.		86				
86	12	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Reach Construct development milestones to get special materials.		87				
87	12	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	I'm sure you'll find them useful...						
88	13	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Here's a message for you, rookie.		89				
89	13	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	There have been sightings of very powerful Corrupted.		90				
90	13	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	You should not attempt to combat these powerful foes on your own.		91				
91	13	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Join a Co-op operation to prove your ability to work with others.		92				
92	13	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	I have high expectations for you, Gray Raven.						
93	110	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Most operations often involve multiple squads.		94				
94	110	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	You can request assistance from other squads before a battle.		95				
95	110	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Try issuing a call for Constructs from other squads.						
96	14	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Commandant, remember Mr. Hassen's tip?		97				
97	14	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	The more you know, the more decisions you face.		98				
98	14	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	As your relationship with Constructs improves, you will be able to access more of their personal files.		99				
99	14	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Let me give you some advice. As you learn more about their past...		100				
100	14	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Make sure you treasure your present and future with them.						
101	15	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Commandant, we have received a new coating from HQ.		102				
102	15	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Coatings are purely cosmetic and do not affect Construct performance.		103				
103	15	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Um... Commandant, would you like me to put on a new coating?						
104	16	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Let's do some bounty missions, Commandant!		105				
105	16	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Oh, right. I need to explain them to you.		106				
106	16	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Completing bounty missions will earn your team a lot of experience.		107				
107	16	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	But more importantly, bounty hunting sounds real cool!						
108	17	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png							
109	18	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, the Dormitory is finally open!		110				
110	18	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	This symbolizes that we are ready to take root on Earth for the long haul.		111				
111	18	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	I'm looking forward to living in the dorms with everybody!		112				
112	18	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	You can also modify and upgrade the Dormitory.		113				
113	18	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	I'm sure you'll make it a great place!						
114	19	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	Which would you prefer, competition or cooperation?		115				
115	19	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	Whether for honor or for resources, everything in the War Zone is earned through competition.		116				
116	19	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	Earn a high enough rank to access a new War Zone...		117				
117	19	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	...Which will grant even better rewards.		118				
118	19	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	This is the ultimate trial ground for Gray Raven. How far can you go?						
119	20	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	Good. I was worried that you won't pick up the receiver.		120				
120	20	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	I've been analyzing Gray Raven's battle logs.		121				
121	20	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	It looks like those special enemies have been giving you a hard time.		122				
122	20	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	I'm giving you permission to use the training facilities to simulate training against these special enemies.		123				
123	20	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	Get used to fighting them quickly, because enemies will only get tougher.						
124	21	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	Are you as curious about this world as I am, Commandant of Gray Raven?		125				
125	21	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	I long to return to Earth as much as you do, even though I was not born there.		126				
126	21	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	There are so many secrets waiting to be discovered in the wastelands...		127				
127	21	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	If you're interested, I can tell you about some... special places that we've found.						
128	22	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Greetings, Commandant. You now have access to the Medal system.		129				
129	22	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Medals are issued to those who have contributed to the cause of the United Human Front. You can find yours in the Central Database.						
130	23	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Thanks to your hard work, Babylonia is able to establish a foothold on the ground.		131				
131	23	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	This is a new start for us, so here comes your next mission.		132				
132	23	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	You're about to head to the "Reconstruction Zone" located near the safe zones.		133				
133	23	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Eliminate all the remaining enemies and restart the Central Purification Filters, so our Engineering Force can start their work.		134				
134	23	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	I'll cover more detail after the Central Purification Filters are completed.						
135	555	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	I want to talk to you about Gray Raven's recent performance.		136				
136	555	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	Your recent performance has been exemplary, and you have earned the medal of Ace Commandant.		137				
137	555	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	With achievement also comes expectation. I look forward to your next victory.		138				
138	555	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	I've sent you the certification link. Go ahead and claim your medal!						
139	556	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	It has been a long time since I've seen so many dots on the monitor. These dots represent the bases of humanity.		140				
140	556	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	You've completed the mission successfully. And your contributions to Babylonia are well-noted.		141				
141	556	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	I hereby issue you the Medal of Pioneers in recognition of your achievements. I look forward to your future endeavors!		142				
142	556	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Go, claim this medal of glory now.						
143	557	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	Hmph, you are full of surprises.		144				
144	557	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	It's been a long time since I last saw a commandant reach 1 million Progress. You were only a little slower than my performance when I was young.		145				
145	557	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	You should be proud of it. It's an exclusive club of two.		146				
146	557	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	You are now authorized for the medal. Claim it now!						
147	558	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	This is the 9th liberation report from you. It seemed like an eternity ago that you and your team fought in your first battle...		148				
148	558	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	You and your Constructs have grown into a true team, a bright beacon in the darkness. Your companions also indicate your strength.		149				
149	558	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Here is the Medal of Light Tower in honor of your achievements as the guiding light of humanity.		150				
150	558	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Now share the joy with your comrades!						
151	559	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	I've seen you overcome many challenges in your path.		152				
152	559	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	The path of leadership that you walk brings back many memories.		153				
153	559	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	On behalf of the United Humanity Front, I hereby issue to you the Medal of Human Leader.		154				
154	559	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	From now on, your duty is not to earn the approval of others, but to bring them hope and point them towards the future. See you on the bridge.						
155	599	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Congratulations on the capture of City 015, Commandant. The Engineering Force is already on its way to repair the city's Central Purification Filter.		156				
156	599	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Be careful, however, as there are still pockets of Corrupted on the outskirts.						
157	600	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	A small step for your team, a great step towards victory over the Punishing Virus.		158				
158	600	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Gray Raven's efforts have led to the full retreat of the Ascendant from this city, as well as the establishment of our first major base on Earth. I look forward to your future performance.						
159	601	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	You have not only recaptured a base for humanity, but also preserved the artifacts of the museum. Good job.		160				
160	601	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	The Archaeological Team sends their regards. We'll make sure that you're rewarded!						
161	602	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Good job completing your mission in the harsh environment of the desert.		162				
162	602	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	We've struggled to make headways in this region for a long time, now, we've finally established a foothold here thanks to you. The work of Babylonia can finally be carried out smoothly.						
163	603	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	The data that you obtained from the test area are of great... historical importance to the development of M.I.N.D. technology.		164				
164	603	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	I thank you on behalf of the education center under the Science Council.						
165	604	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	I'm sure you understand that details regarding the Luna City Arsenal are classified.		166				
166	604	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	That's why we're not in a position to hold a public award ceremony for you.		167				
167	604	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Still, you should know that we appreciate your work.						
168	605	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	The murals... Sagemachina... interesting.		169				
169	605	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	Your capture of these ruins allows us to investigate them up close. Good job.						
170	606	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Taking back the space station means a lot to the security of the surroundings of Babylonia in future.		171				
171	606	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	On behalf of Babylonia, I would like to thank you for your outstanding contribution. I look forward to your return.						
172	607	1	Jamilah	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/JiamilaNormal01.png	Looks like it went well.		173				
173	607	1	Jamilah	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/JiamilaNormal01.png	I knew you could do it.		174				
174	607	1	Jamilah	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/JiamilaNormal01.png	By the way, have you considered our offer? Akdilek would be pleased to have you join us, anytime.						
175	608	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal01.png	Many thanks for your assistance.		176				
176	608	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal01.png	The problems here are mostly resolved. The ship will now sail to the right direction.		177				
177	608	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal01.png	But nobody knows what awaits us at the destination...		178				
178	608	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal01.png	Whatever. It was you who brought us the opportunity to change. Thanks!						
179	609	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Good to see you back.		180				
180	609	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Humans suffered quite a loss this time, but it's okay. Because I still see hope in your eyes.		181				
181	609	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Alright, we still have lots to do, but you should take a good rest now.		182				
182	609	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	There's someone waiting for you, don't forget.						
183	700	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Thanks for spending time with them.		184				
184	700	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	We've been able to enjoy the holidays thanks to you.		185				
185	700	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Have a good rest. I've prepared a little gift for you back at HQ. Check it out later!						
186	701	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	I've never been part of an event like this... It feels a little strange.		187				
187	701	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	But I enjoy seeing the smile on everybody's faces.		188				
188	701	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Here's a little gift. I hope you like it.						
189	702	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Hey, Commandant, guess what I have for you?		190				
190	702	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	It's my special New Year present!		191				
191	702	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Wait, where did it go? I thought I put it in my bag...		192				
192	702	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Did I already send it out? Let's go take a look!						
193	703	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Happy New Year, Commandant.		194				
194	703	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Thank you for all that you've done this past year.		195				
195	703	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	May the next year be just as productive.						
196	704	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Commandant, Commandant! Happy New Year!		197				
197	704	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Miss me already?		198				
198	704	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Guess what, Nanami's got a New Year present for you!		199				
199	704	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Happy? Like it? This is the part where you praise Nanami!						
200	705	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	It was quite a surprise when you asked me to come over for Spring Festival.		201				
201	705	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	But I really enjoyed it!		202				
202	705	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Here's a little something in return.		203				
203	705	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Keep it a secret between us, ok?						
204	706	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	I'm definitely not saying that I enjoyed Spring Festival with you guys!		205				
205	706	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	I'm just saying that if you're gonna have a party, you need fireworks!		206				
206	706	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Luckily for you, I've got them prepared.		207				
207	706	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	And since it's boring to watch fireworks by myself, I'll let you watch them together with me.						
208	24	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Alright, the regular update is complete. Everyone is dismissed. Commandant, please stay for a moment.		209				
209	24	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	So let's get down to business on Camu.		210				
210	24	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	As you may already know, Camu's body and mind are very special, and he is more suitable to fight in areas with high concentration of Punishing Virus.		211				
211	24	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	According to preliminary research by the Science Council, Camu is able to perform missions in areas inaccessible to ordinary constructs.		212				
212	24	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	I hope you can continue to connect with him remotely when fighting in high concentration areas—take care of him.						
213	800	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	I've already uploaded today's battle data analysis report onto the system. Once we've collected enough data, I'll hand in a Construct refinement report to the Council.		214				
214	800	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Upgrading a Construct's frame needs to be done with extreme caution. The process requires constant optimization and fine-tuning. It's not something that can be done in a day, but the wait is worthwhile.		215				
215	800	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	This is the end of today's report... By the way, I found out that today is a celebration in the west back in the Golden Age where... people gave gifts to those dear to them.		216				
216	800	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Don't get me wrong, I just think that celebrations are a core part of humanity, and for a certain someone to miss out on this important event would be... unfortunate.		217				
217	800	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Which is why, in order to make sure you don't miss out, I'll... always be here by your side, celebration or not. Happy Valentine's, KURONAME.						
218	801	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, today is a very important day in the Golden Age western culture, do you know what it is? It's the day of love!		219				
219	801	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Back in the Golden Age, people on Earth would give chocolates to the people they love, and the streets were filled with happy couples.		220				
220	801	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	...I feel happy just thinking about it. I hope the world will be filled with love again once we reclaim Earth.		221				
221	801	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	I wanted to experience it too, so I made some chocolates...		222				
222	801	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	If it's not too much, will you accept these, Commandant?						
223	802	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Commandant! Happy Valentine's Day! I read that on Valentine's Day, you confessed your love. In the visual nov... I mean, the information I found! Valentine's Day is the day you spend with the most important person in your life!		224				
224	802	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	And to me, that person is, of course, you, Commandant! Am I your most important person too, Commandant? I am, right? Right?		225				
225	802	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Hehe, anyway, I've prepared Valentine Serum chocolate for you! I've put tons of sugar in it. Nothing says Valentine's Day like it, right?		226				
226	802	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	If you have time... could you come to my room tonight... I found a fighting game popular during the Golden Age! You're gonna love it! We can play it all night long!						
227	803	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Commandant, for all the times we've gone through, thank you for your leadership and guidance... Why did I say these things?		228				
228	803	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	...According to the information of Golden Age festivals, today is the day where people expressed their feelings to their beloved with chocolate as a gift. Is it correct?		229				
229	803	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	I see, so the information is true... You haven't misunderstood. Commandant is no doubt the one I like.		230				
230	803	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	I've prepared hand-made chocolates for you. But I'm not... very familiar with this. I promise I will work harder on it, Commandant.		231				
231	803	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Happy Valentine's Day, Commandant.						
232	804	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Hey hey! It's Nanami! Commandant, do you know what day it is today?		233				
233	804	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Yep! It's Valentine's Day! Do you feel your heart is racing a bit faster?		234				
234	804	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Speaking of Valentine's Day, chocolate is the thing we definitely can't miss!		235				
235	804	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Ms. Celica said if there is a very very important person to you, you have to make a very very yummy chocolate as a present. So Nanami has spent a whole night... or two days... a long time anyway, to make this!		236				
236	804	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	You have to enjoy it slowly! Nanami won't allow you to swallow it in only one bite!						
237	805	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time, Commandant of Gray Raven.		238				
238	805	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	According to the database, today is a vital western festival during the Golden Age, Valentine's Day.		239				
239	805	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	On this day, people used to make chocolates that contained their feelings and give it to the person who was important to them.		240				
240	805	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	If you don't mind, please accept this. I don't know if you like sweets or not... but I hope you will like it.		241				
241	805	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	...Happy White Day, KURONAME.						
242	806	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	What? I couldn't care less about this boring festival.		243				
243	806	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	But, well, since you look forward to that, I've prepared chocolates for you, just because I don't want to let you down.		244				
244	806	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Hmph, they're not exquisite, but I'm sure they will impress you!						
245	807	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	Commandant! Happy Valentine's Day! On this day, what cannot be missed is chocolate!		246				
246	807	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	Hehe... Look! Special chocolate made by me! The proportion of sugar, milk and cocoa is 1:2:4, which is a golden formula showed in Golden Age movies! Also I've used solidified serum jelly as stuffing!		247				
247	807	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	By the way, this serum is slightly different. After all... we've shared some mutual secrets, right?		248				
248	807	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	What? Have I tasted it before? How could I taste it before you do? It's a big gift to KURONAME!						
249	808	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	BZZZZ—Can you hear me? The signal here's a bit unstable... What's with that face? You worried about me? As you can see, there's nothing to worry about. I'm fine.		250				
250	808	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	This is for you, made with raw dark chocolate and Serum. I used to eat this kind of chocolate in the army all the time to refresh myself.		251				
251	808	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	Yeah, I made it. What? It's not that hard to make chocolate... Why am I giving you chocolate? Do you really need me to explain?		252				
252	808	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	Happy Valentine's Day. I'll be waiting for you outside Oasis later. You're worried about me, right? Then come see for yourself that I'm fine.						
253	809	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	*WARNING! The communication channel has been hacked! Please disconnect it immediately!*		254				
254	809	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	This is for you.		255				
255	809	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	I'm sure you won't feel alone today as you have Gray Ravens by your side.		256				
256	809	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	But still... Happy Valentine's Day.						
257	900	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Happy Children's Day, Commandant of Gray Raven.		258				
258	900	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Speaking of which, why do I still have to work today?! Am I not eligible? Don't you think I should have a day off?		259				
259	900	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Whatever, I've finished my work. How about I go have some fun at your dormitory? Don't tell President Hassen!		260				
260	900	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	I'll go get some balloons and candies. See you later!						
261	1010	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	I found this flower during one of the missions. After looking up the database, I realized it was from the same taxonomical family as the one you gave me.		262				
262	1010	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Seeing this flower... made me think of someone. Such coincidence was an extremely rare event, statistically.		263				
263	1010	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	To me, it was of significant value for research... I preserved it, so I could give it to the person it led me to.		264				
264	1010	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	According to the data from Golden Age, flowers had a language of their own. So... here's my reply to you.						
265	1020	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Commandant, everybody told me to come here because I got a gift from you before. What did they mean by that?		266				
266	1020	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Are you trying to tell me something? Sorry I can't hear you, you're stuttering quite a bit.		267				
267	1020	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Just say it. I'll remember everything you say. Anything.						
268	1030	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, I planted this rose myself...		269				
269	1030	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Sorry that I never told you about this. I just wanted to give you a surprise today...		270				
270	1030	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	But I never thought that you would give me a flower first.		271				
271	1030	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Thank you... I'm so happy.						
272	1040	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	Commandant, as a leader, you should manage your work-life balance.		273				
273	1040	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	Seeing your white rose reminded me of what other team members said about this day.		274				
274	1040	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	This is a day you'd want to spend with your dream partner...		275				
275	1040	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	I've brought you this rose in the hope that it would bring you my most sincere prayers and wishes.						
276	1050	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Oooh? FOR ME?		277				
277	1050	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Nanami's so glad! I hope you're as glad as I am!		278				
278	1050	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Let Nanami see... Ahah, there it is!		279				
279	1050	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Ta-da! Take it, Commandant! It's one of Nanami's best stuff!						
280	1060	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Commandant, you copy? This is Kamui from an encrypted private channel. Make sure you listen to this! *Beep—*		281				
281	1060	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Hey, Commandant, you busy? It's been a while since we last spoke!		282				
282	1060	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	It's White Day today! You sent me flowers, didn't you? I'm the only one to receive your gift of love, right?		283				
283	1060	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	I'm so happy! Commandant, I've got something for you too! See, I went to the park and picked the most beautiful rose there!		284				
284	1060	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	So, will you come and find me on White Day every year? It's a deal then! I'll always be waiting for you!						
285	1070	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Pah, knew you'd be drowning in your reports in the office. Hey, you don't have anything else on, do you?		286				
286	1070	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	No? Good...		287				
287	1070	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Why am I sitting on a sofa all of a sudden?		288				
288	1070	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	I sit where I want to sit!		289				
289	1070	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	By the way... You're free tonight, aren't you? Silence is compliance!						
290	1080	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	Morning, Commandant. How's work? I just... got your gift.		291				
291	1080	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	Such a gift on such a day... Are you trying to tell me something?		292				
292	1080	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	Well, in that case... Just remember to check your mailbox later.		293				
293	1080	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	If you like it, I'll take you to the sea of flowers the next time you come to Oasis.						
294	1090	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LuxiyaNormal01.png	Commandant, here's my gift for you in return. I'm not very good at this, so please forgive me if you don't like it...		295				
295	1090	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LuxiyaNormal01.png	But I will keep trying... To become your weapon that can cut through all the obstacles, and... to become the best Construct in your mind.						
296	1100	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, you don't have to do this.		297				
297	1100	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LifuNormal01.png	I love the flowers, but what I really want is...		298				
298	1100	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LifuNormal01.png	To have you by my side.						
299	1110	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	I found this rose in some ruins during a mission long ago.		300				
300	1110	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	It was so beautiful. According to the database, on certain important dates, people in the Golden Age would give such flowers... to their important ones.		301				
301	1110	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	I recorded all its data, including the angle of every single petal, in my M.I.N.D. so I could restore it. It is the only rose I have stored in my M.I.N.D... And I hope you can see it too.						
302	1120	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, thanks for your rose. I love it.		303				
303	1120	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LifuNormal01.png	Actually... I have a little surprise for you too.		304				
304	1120	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LifuNormal01.png	Can you come to the deck of Babylonia later?						
305	1130	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3ShenweiNormal01.png	Hey, Commandant, you busy? Mind if I spare some of your time?		306				
306	1130	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3ShenweiNormal01.png	I got your gift, so I was wondering if I should do something to return your favor. How about I give myself to you... Joking! Hehe.		307				
307	1130	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3ShenweiNormal01.png	Anyway, I've got a little surprise for you, and you only! Don't tell anyone else!		308				
308	1130	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3ShenweiNormal01.png	Make sure you take good care of it! I want to stay with you forever, just like this gift.						
309	1140	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3KalieninaNormal01.png	What? You should've expected me today when you gave me that last month.		310				
310	1140	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3KalieninaNormal01.png	So what's with this stupid outfit? You look miserably clueless!		311				
311	1140	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3KalieninaNormal01.png	Whatever, just give me your hand. Don't you know how to hold hands?		312				
312	1140	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3KalieninaNormal01.png	O-oi, don't grab me all of a sudden! Don't use so much force, you dumbo!						
313	1150	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3Yongyechaonormal01.png	I'm back! It's a me! Na☆na☆mi!		314				
314	1150	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3Yongyechaonormal01.png	Why didn't you tell Nanami earlier?! Do you know how difficult it is to take this out?		315				
315	1150	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3Yongyechaonormal01.png	I had to return to the lab within 15 sec, then smash—I mean borrow the liquid nitrogen container, and rush back here!		316				
316	1150	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3Yongyechaonormal01.png	Let me think... You shall have a one-day date with Nanami as punishment!						
317	1160	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	Waiting for me...? Guess not. Whatever.		318				
318	1160	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	I never thought you would care about such a date in Babylonia.		319				
319	1160	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	Honestly, that gift of yours wasn't very useful. In other words, I didn't like it.		320				
320	1160	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	If you are ever going to give me something again... Just pack yourself up and come to the Ascendant's base.						
321	1170	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	Commandant, it's been a while. How have you been?		322				
322	1170	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	I found a rose in an abandoned base while patrolling. I didn't know why, but you were the first thing that came to my M.I.N.D... So I brought it back in the hope that you would like it.		323				
323	1170	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	Then I saw your gift. You were thinking exactly what I was thinking, weren't you?		324				
324	1170	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	I have put your rose in a vase. Hope I can see you before it withers, if possible.						
325	1180	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2ErrorNormal01.png	Happy White Day, Commandant! I didn't expect to get a gift from you.		326				
326	1180	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2ErrorNormal01.png	Ah... What I mean is, I'm actually very happy.		327				
327	1180	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2ErrorNormal01.png	Because it was the first time that I got such a valuable gift. Well, Commandant, are you ready for my "real gift"?						
328	1190	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3BiankaNormal01.png	Thanks for your gift, Commandant.		329				
329	1190	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3BiankaNormal01.png	By the way, "314 Days With You" just hits the theaters today. Let's watch it together.		330				
330	1190	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3BiankaNormal01.png	And... There's something I want to tell you too.						
331	1200	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	So this is true...		332				
332	1200	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	This is for you.		333				
333	1200	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	I heard today was a day to exchange gifts with important ones.		334				
334	1200	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	I spent a lot of time preparing this.						
335	1210	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	Incoming communication from Strike Hawk—Chrome's dedicated channel.		336				
336	1210	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	Commandant of Gray Raven, please, allow me to call you by your name this time.		337				
337	1210	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	KURONAME, I have received your gift. I don't know if I understood your intentions correctly...		338				
338	1210	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	Speaking of roses, I wonder if you have ever heard of "Unter der Rose"—		339				
339	1210	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	I know this may not be allowed, but I want to be there with you.						
340	25	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Oh, you've already received the mission details, haven't you?		341				
341	25	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Codenamed "Operation Guardians", it's a regular patrolling mission that requires all commandants' participation.		342				
342	25	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	It aims to help commandants get accustomed to the Earth's environment and secure the safety of each conservation area.		343				
343	25	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	The details will be provided once you get there. The transport of equipment and personnel is ready now.						
344	901	1	POD	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PodNormal01.png	The integration compilation of the four unnamed records has been completed and the final hidden record has been exported.		345				
345	901	1	POD	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PodNormal01.png	This hidden record has unknown network connection performance and signs of data disorder, and reading may cause additional risks.		346				
346	901	1	POD	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PodNormal01.png	After all, it is just the record of "others".		347				
347	901	1	POD	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PodNormal01.png	If read, it means a connection with "others" would form, resulting in unpredictable consequences.		348				
348	901	1	POD	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PodNormal01.png	Even so, will you try to read the final hidden record?						
349	2001	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Everyone says today is a special day, but there's no official record of it in my database.		350				
350	2001	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	White Day...? This is the first time I've heard of it.		351				
351	2001	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Although I can't fully comprehend the meaning behind this festival, I understand that it's a day you spend with someone you like.		352				
352	2001	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	I appreciate that you're willing to spend the day with me, even when it's unrelated to any mission.		353				
353	2001	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	You won't have to ask me—I'll always follow you, Commandant, as one of the Gray Ravens.						
354	2002	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LuxiyaNormal01.png	I'm not particularly perceptive about this, so I wanted to check with you again, Commandant.		355				
355	2002	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LuxiyaNormal01.png	Did you want me to visit Venus Splash Park with you because it is White Day today?		356				
356	2002	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LuxiyaNormal01.png	Ah, I see... and I thought I was here as a bodyguard.		357				
357	2002	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LuxiyaNormal01.png	Regardless, I'm glad that I'm more than just your blade on the battlefield, Commandant, and that I can accompany you on a day like this.						
358	2003	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	Commandant, thank you for accompanying me on this special day.		359				
359	2003	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	I had a really good time. I'll keep this feeling of happiness forever in my M.I.N.D. so that I'll never forget it.		360				
360	2003	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	You have always been the person I care... and respect the most, Commandant. It was you who made me understand that I'm more than just a weapon.		361				
361	2003	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	I hope that I get to spend every White Day with you like today in the years to come.						
362	2004	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	*WARNING! The communication channel has been hacked! Please disconnect it immediately!*		363				
363	2004	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	Have you been waiting for me to call again?		364				
364	2004	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	Even with all those around you, you're still choosing to spend today with me. Do you understand what it implies?		365				
365	2004	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	Are you that lonely...? Huh, or were you worried that I'd be alone? Such unfounded concerns.		366				
366	2004	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	Stop worrying about these meaningless things. Unlike you, I enjoy my solitude. You should be more concerned about yourself instead of me.						
367	2005	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	The report on Venus Splash Park's restoration was uploaded to the Science Council. It seems that the Engineering Force hasn't been slacking.		368				
368	2005	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Construction on the essential conservation area settlement is 72.5% complete. Apart from that, repairs on recreational facilities are 45% complete, somehow. I can't say if the Engineering Force is efficient or if there is just a high demand for that kind of facility.		369				
369	2005	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Why are you looking at me like that... Let's be clear—I'm here at the Venus Splash Park with you to collect data. That's all.		370				
370	2005	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Fine... Of course I know what day it is today. As I told you before, festivals are humanity's shared memories. I wouldn't want to miss any of them, essential or not.		371				
371	2005	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Including today. Understand?						
372	2006	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	Are you going to bed already? That's fair. You've been out having fun the whole day, after all. It's about time you get some rest.		373				
373	2006	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	I've just performed maintenance on my frame and cleaned out the salt and sand in my joints.		374				
374	2006	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	I told you not to run around on the beach. Had you not dived into the waves, I wouldn't have needed to get you back and...		375				
375	2006	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	Your behaviors are giving me a headache… I looked happy? I wasn't... I only went in because I didn't want my commandant washed away by the waves. That's all.		376				
376	2006	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	Forget it. You won't listen no matter what I say. It's a special day today, after all, so I'm glad you had fun.		377				
377	2006	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	Good night, and... Happy White Day, Commandant.						
378	2007	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, thank you so much for taking me to the Venus Splash Park on White Day...		379				
379	2007	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	I'm glad I got to spend time being close to you.		380				
380	2007	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	...Sorry, it's... embarrassing to say it out loud.		381				
381	2007	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, you must be tired now. Please rest up. I'll leave you be.						
382	2008	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LifuNormal01.png	Happy White Day, Commandant.		383				
383	2008	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LifuNormal01.png	Spending today at Venus Splash Park with you... was the best day I've had in quite a while.		384				
384	2008	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LifuNormal01.png	I would have spent more time with you, Commandant, but there are only so many hours in a day... It's time for you to rest.		385				
385	2008	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LifuNormal01.png	Every moment with you is a miracle for me. I'll keep these memories in my journal.						
386	2009	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, are you going to rest? I'm still unpacking the gifts you gave me today, but I'll be with you shortly.		387				
387	2009	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LifuNormal01.png	I didn't want to bother you with unnecessary calls, but there are things I just cannot say in person...		388				
388	2009	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LifuNormal01.png	Thank you very much for taking me to the Venus Splash Park on this special day, Commandant. Maybe you didn't realize… but for me, it meant a lot...		389				
389	2009	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LifuNormal01.png	I'm almost done with my things. I'll be there soon, Commandant.						
390	2010	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Commandant! Happy White Day! Hehe... Of course I know it is White Day today! I knew I had triggered... something important when you came to me!		391				
391	2010	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	So you took me to Venus Splash Park because you selected my route? Regardless, my route for you has never changed!		392				
392	2010	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Did you enjoy today, Commandant? Have I picked the best options to increase my Affection?						
393	2011	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3ShenweiNormal01.png	You seem happy today, Commandant. You haven't stopped laughing... Because of me? I told you I'd keep smiling for you as long as you like.		394				
394	2011	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3ShenweiNormal01.png	Did you take me to Venus Splash Park today to cheer me up? Here I thought it was because it's White Day today... Ah! You must know what it is, Commandant!		395				
395	2011	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3ShenweiNormal01.png	See, you know it... So can I call it a date? It was a date! Crap—now I have to play a few rounds of fighting games to calm down! Yep! Sounds good! Good night, Commandant!		396				
396	2011	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3ShenweiNormal01.png	I'm not inviting you to my room to play with me. You are not staying overnight! Why? Because I want to wake up early and see you well-rested and energized!						
397	2012	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	Commandant, the female members of the force just reminded me that it is a special day today.		398				
398	2012	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	I'm sorry I didn't realize what day it was. I was wondering why you invited me to Venus Splash Park with you.		399				
399	2012	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	No, you didn't keep away from any of my work. I finished them in advance in order to join you. I should thank you for having me.		400				
400	2012	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	White Day... I've been told it's connected to Valentine's Day. How are they connected?		401				
401	2012	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	Please tell me more if you don't mind. I would love to keep listening to you talk, Commandant.						
402	2013	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3BiankaNormal01.png	White Day...? No, I didn't know about it.		403				
403	2013	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3BiankaNormal01.png	I only learned about Valentine's Day from the database not too long ago, so I wasn't expecting a day for people to reciprocate a month later. So this is what it's for... Good. I get it now.		404				
404	2013	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3BiankaNormal01.png	Offensive? No, it's not offensive. It may not be my idea of a traditional festival, but the meaning of a festival has always been given by the people who celebrate it.		405				
405	2013	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3BiankaNormal01.png	The important thing is how people view it now. The time I spent with you today has been fulfilling and endearing, and that's good enough.						
406	2014	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Hey! What took you so long to answer?! Were you drifting off?!		407				
407	2014	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Answer my call immediately next time, do you hear me?! Don't make me wait! What? You're tired?		408				
408	2014	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Tch! Turns out the Gray Raven Commandant is so weak and puny. We only walked around Venus Splash Park today, and you're already exhausted?		409				
409	2014	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	...Tch. Then get your *** to bed already... What?! I wasn't worried! I—WAS—NOT!		410				
410	2014	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	But now that you've answered my call... Happy... White... Day. What?! **** you! I thought that was what... Whatever! Get out of here!						
411	2015	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3KalieninaNormal01.png	You answered me right away. You've been waiting for my call, haven't you?		412				
412	2015	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3KalieninaNormal01.png	What the ****? Why aren't you resting now that you're back? Do I need to remind you of something like this?!		413				
413	2015	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3KalieninaNormal01.png	Don't get me wrong! I wasn't being worried. Who else is going to the water fight with me on a day like this if you're too tired to go?		414				
414	2015	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3KalieninaNormal01.png	What the hell are you waiting for... I'm going to hang up!		415				
415	2015	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3KalieninaNormal01.png	Tch—Fine! Happy White Day! Are you happy? GO—TO—BED—RIGHT—NOW!						
416	2016	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Ta-da! Nanami is BACK! I know we just parted, but do you miss me, Commandant? I know you do! Because Nanami is already missing you!		417				
417	2016	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Nanami had a great day today! I've always wanted to experience White Day, but none of my "friends" could accompany me on this special day.		418				
418	2016	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Not to mention that even Nanami knows that this isn't just a day you hang out with your friends!		419				
419	2016	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Promise me you'll take Nanami to celebrate different festivals like we did today, Commandant!						
420	2017	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3Yongyechaonormal01.png	Argh! Commandant! Why does it feel like years already when we've just parted?		421				
421	2017	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3Yongyechaonormal01.png	It must be because I lost to you in the Game Center earlier! No one ever beat me in a video game!		422				
422	2017	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3Yongyechaonormal01.png	So, when should we visit Venus Splash Park again? Nanami can't wait! I'd play games with you every day if I could, Commandant!		423				
423	2017	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3Yongyechaonormal01.png	Of course Nanami knows it is a special day today... But it doesn't matter what we do. It always feels like a date when Nanami is with you!						
424	2018	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	Thank you for today, Gray Raven Commandant. Venus Splash Park is indeed a nice place. Babylonia has done a respectable job turning it into a settlement.		425				
425	2018	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	If it is possible... I wish those abandoned and forgotten could visit this place.		426				
426	2018	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	Sorry for thinking out loud. I know you didn't invite me today for boring and serious discussions. I just never could stop thinking about them.		427				
427	2018	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	...Anyway, thank you very much for inviting me on a day like this. Little as it may be... it has changed how I see Babylonia.						
428	2019	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	Buzz—It's finally stable now. Can you hear me? It's me. I'm back at the Forsaken camp.		429				
429	2019	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	My hair is messy? Oh, the children here "robbed" me when I got back. They're feasting on all the candies you gave me now.		430				
430	2019	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	Ha... I'm kidding. I knew you prepared the candies for them. My apologies—I know I don't act like this very often around you... I had a really good time today.		431				
431	2019	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	I still looked weighted down sometimes? I... I suppose I can't help worrying about my comrades even on a day like this.		432				
432	2019	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	However, when the children asked me about the date... I couldn't help remembering it fondly.		433				
433	2019	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	Perhaps contradiction is part of our nature. Anyway... Thank you for today. I look forward to... the next one.						
434	2020	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KuluomuNomal01.png	*Incoming communication from Strike Hawk—Chrome's dedicated channel.*		435				
435	2020	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KuluomuNomal01.png	You must be back by now, Gray Raven Commandant—I mean, KURONAME. I'm sorry to bother you at this hour.		436				
436	2020	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KuluomuNomal01.png	It's just that some feelings can only be shared after I carefully choose my words.		437				
437	2020	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KuluomuNomal01.png	I don't think I've misinterpreted why you invited me to Venus Splash Park today. It was my honor to spend the day with you.		438				
438	2020	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KuluomuNomal01.png	But next time, allow me to take the initiative.						
439	2021	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	I've shared with Jamilah what we did today.		440				
440	2021	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	Jamilah told me to thank you again. That's why I'm calling you.		441				
441	2021	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	Thank you, KURONAME. I don't quite understand what it means, but I know that today is special.		442				
442	2021	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	All I know is... I enjoy being with you.						
443	2022	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	When will you stop playing house? Did you think you can get rid of me by taking me to a park?		444				
444	2022	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	How presumptuous of you. Am I such an impressionable idiot in your eyes?		445				
445	2022	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	What? Did you say I looked happy today? Ha—have you forgotten what I put you through already, Gray Raven Commandant? How dare you speak to me like that?!		446				
446	2022	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	What you did today hasn't satisfied me at all. I'm a lot more greedy and predatory than you think. I'll take more and more... You get it, Commandant.						
447	2023	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	I hate these boring festivals, and I hate that boring park. I especially hate going to that park on one of those festivals. What? Do you take me for a child?		448				
448	2023	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Why did I stay if I found them boring? What a stupid question! I was there to keep an eye on you! You were so excited that I thought you'd have jumped off the Ferris wheel if I weren't paying attention.		449				
449	2023	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Besides, if it weren't for the fact that you were kind of interesting among all this boring nonsense, I would've been gone already.		450				
450	2023	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Don't deal with me the way you deal with Kamui. I'm not that idiot. I always know what I want, KURONAME.						
451	2024	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	I couldn't believe how big the difference was between the arctic and tropical regions. I was shocked by the heat when I arrived at the park.		452				
452	2024	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	While the arctic is still covered in ice, there's another part of the world that's bright and warm.		453				
453	2024	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	There were no howling winds or blizzards. The Forest Guards are not afraid of the cold, but to find places where fires are not needed for warmth... It's incredible.		454				
454	2024	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	Huh? Today is... White Day? It's the first time I've heard of it... But doesn't White stand for the snow in the arctic?						
455	2025	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal01.png	Did you bring me there today to show me what Babylonia is capable of? Ha. It's nothing compared to what Kowloong can do...		456				
456	2025	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal01.png	No? You took me there because... it's White Day today? What's that?		457				
457	2025	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal01.png	How dare you?! That is no joking matter! There isn't such a festival in Kowloong, so it's understandable that I'd know nothing of this foreign tradition.		458				
458	2025	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal01.png	But I see what it could represent... If this day matters so much to you, I'll wish you a "Happy White Day".		459				
459	2025	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal01.png	That place was so noisy and crowded. I do not hate a metropolis, but some words are not meant to be said in a place like that.		460				
460	2025	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal01.png	Not that I mind someone keeping me company...						
461	2026	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Hehe, KURONAME, look... That's right. These are the coins I won at Game Center!		462				
462	2026	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	It's the first time I see so many coins in one bucket. I bet I'm a billionaire now... What? I can't use these coins outside the Game Center?		463				
463	2026	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	How can this be... I was going to use them to buy a gift for you in return...		464				
464	2026	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Forget it. At least I'm still the richest one in the Game Center. So, when are you going to the park with me again? I'll give you half of my coins!						
465	2027	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	Should I take today as a gesture of goodwill?		466				
466	2027	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	What you offered today was indeed wonderful. But time passes; festivals will be forgotten and parks will decay. Everything we have now is but a meaningless and fleeting gasp before we reach our end.		467				
467	2027	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	To be, and then to perish, that is the world, for better or worse.		468				
468	2027	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	If you expect the same, I'm willing to make this gasp last a little longer.						
469	2028	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	Happy White Day! Commandant!		470				
470	2028	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	Of course I remember this special day! Didn't you take me to Venus Splash Park because of it?		471				
471	2028	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	I enjoyed spending the day with you, Commandant! The blue ocean, yellow sand, and white clouds... Thank you for gifting me so many colors and inspirations.		472				
472	2028	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	I've decided to paint everything I saw today on my canvas right now... Of course, the most essential color is you!		473				
473	2028	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	I wish you could become a color that only I can use all the time. It is said that artists who excel with a color can name it after themselves...		474				
474	2028	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	But I will give you that right instead. Then, you'll be able to stay on my easel... and with me.						
475	2029	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	……Hello? Can you hear me? Hold on... Ahem…		476				
476	2029	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	My apologies. I'm still not used to communicating through comms, but there is something I feel like I must tell you today face-to-face with my voice.		477				
477	2029	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	I had a wonderful day. Thank you for taking me to a dream that has yet to yield to reality, KURONAME.		478				
478	2029	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	I couldn't help but wish it were summer... But spring is also full of life, and this ocean feels like summer all year round.		479				
479	2029	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	So allow me to conclude this call by adapting a line from one of my favorite poems––		480				
480	2029	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	Shall I compare thee to a spring's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate, but thy eternal summer shall not fade, KURONAME.						
481	2030	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	Hello? Are you back yet? Are you going to bed? Um... I've lain down in the maintenance room already.		482				
482	2030	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	I'm getting ready to enter the sleeping pod. I'm just checking in with you before I go to sleep... Somehow, I can't sleep well without giving you a call.		483				
483	2030	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	The things we did today took so much energy... How strange it is that I feel like I'm in a weightless dream when I'm with you, but exhaustion surges up once we're apart, as if I'm waking up.		484				
484	2030	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	Yawn... Boggles my mind. I'm going to have a nice, long sleep now. Perhaps in my dream, I can stilll... hmm... Never mind.		485				
485	2030	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	Well, then... Happy White Day. Good night, KURONAME.						
486	60001	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	Commandant, I heard today is the day that we are supposed to send gifts to the special people in our lives on this special day, aren't we?		487				
487	60001	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	I found this rose on the battlefield. I... want to give it to you.		488				
488	60001	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	I've combed through some data, and this rose turns out to be pretty ordinary. You can even find it on Babylonia.		489				
489	60001	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	But... it's beautiful. It's such a common sight it's easy to forget that, but that won't change what it is. It is beautiful, isn't it?						
490	60002	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Finally online. You've kept me waiting, Gray Raven Commandant.		491				
491	60002	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	I noticed the gift you sent over. A rose. How fascinating.		492				
492	60002	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	You have to know that they come with thorns, right?		493				
493	60002	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Stay where you are. Yes. There. Now.		494				
494	60002	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	If you insist on screwing around with roses, don't be surprised when they decide to return the favor.						
495	60003	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Kamui mentioned that you humans give each other presents today.		496				
496	60003	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	And it's not about the gift, but the thought behind it? Well, this is what I think about the most.		497				
497	60003	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Take this. I spent some effort gathering all these snacks for you.		498				
498	60003	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	But be careful what you're chomping down. I've hidden something that you won't find until you finish them all.						
499	60004	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	It's customary for the Forest Guard to return the courtesy when we receive a gift.		500				
500	60004	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	Therefore, I'm giving you this rose I picked near our campsite as a token of gratitude.		501				
501	60004	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	Because of the different environment, it might not be as beautiful as the roses you find in other regions.		502				
502	60004	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	But we Forest Guards admire what it represents—to resist the winter cold until spring dawns.		503				
503	60004	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	I hope this flower and I can both bring you solace during difficult times, as we await a better future together.						
504	60005	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	I've received... your gift.		505				
505	60005	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	It seems that, despite geographical variations, it is part of human nature to set a date for "celebration."		506				
506	60005	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	That said, I can see your sincerity in the gift you gave me. I'll consider adding this record to Tabula Akasha.		507				
507	60005	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	...Still unsatisfied? Then I'll give you a gift in return... as a memorial of this day?						
508	60006	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Hey, Commandant! I've got your gift. As I thought, you really know what day it is today!		509				
509	60006	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	I know many interesting festivals, but this is the best among the best 'cause I can get a gift from Commandant!		510				
510	60006	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Hehe, it is courteous to give something back in return after you receive a gift, isn't it?		511				
511	60006	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	See! I've already got it prepared. Don't you worry that I will forget your kindness!						
512	3001	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Do you have time at the moment, Commandant?		513				
513	3001	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	... Nothing special. It's just I want you to have this tutorial CD.		514				
514	3001	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	... Do I know what day today is? Cough, I just randomly grabbed it. It's not something I specially prepared.		515				
515	3001	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Of course this is to prevent you from imposing unreasonable demands on me. I can't conjure up anything out of thin air anytime and anywhere, Commandant.		516				
516	3001	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	You didn't answer my question. Do you have time now?		517				
517	3001	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	About the weapon extension add-on module you asked about... I researched on it a bit. Find me in the lounge if you still want it.						
518	3002	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	Do you have time at the moment, Commandant?		519				
519	3002	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	... Nothing special. It's just I want you to have this tutorial CD.		520				
520	3002	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	... Do I know what day today is? Cough, I just randomly grabbed it. It's not something I specially prepared.		521				
521	3002	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	Of course this is to prevent you from imposing unreasonable demands on me. I can't conjure up anything out of thin air anytime and anywhere, Commandant.		522				
522	3002	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	You didn't answer my question. Do you have time now?		523				
523	3002	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	About the weapon extension add-on module you asked about... I researched on it a bit. Find me in the lounge if you still want it.						
524	3003	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	May 20 is a special day. I've noted it down.		525				
525	3003	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	I prepared a different gift for this year's 5.20 holiday than last year.		526				
526	3003	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	I heard that people in the Golden Age used it to store videos. It's a bit outdated, but I still like it a lot.		527				
527	3003	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	If you don't mind, Commandant, shall we record something for our memory?						
528	3004	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LuxiyaNormal01.png	May 20 is a special day. I've noted it down.		529				
529	3004	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LuxiyaNormal01.png	I prepared a different gift for this year's 5.20 holiday than last year.		530				
530	3004	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LuxiyaNormal01.png	I heard that people in the Golden Age used it to store videos. It's a bit outdated, but I still like it a lot.		531				
531	3004	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LuxiyaNormal01.png	If you don't mind, Commandant, shall we record something for our memory?						
532	3005	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	Another meaningless gift... You are hopeless.		533				
533	3005	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	Alright. I guess I'll have to give you something in return.		534				
534	3005	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	I happened to have recorded something boring. Hmm... I think it's okay to let you have a look.		535				
535	3005	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	I can get you down here from Babylonia if you want to see it with your own eyes.						
536	3006	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	May 20 is a special day. I've noted it down.		537				
537	3006	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	I prepared a different gift for this year's 5.20 holiday than last year.		538				
538	3006	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	I heard that people in the Golden Age used it to store videos. It's a bit outdated, but I still like it a lot.		539				
539	3006	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	If you don't mind, Commandant, shall we record something for our memory?						
540	3007	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	The day has arrived again, Commandant.		541				
541	3007	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	I've been thinking about what I to give you...		542				
542	3007	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	I remember you said you want to learn to sing...		543				
543	3007	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	So I put the practice videos on this CD without your permission.		544				
544	3007	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	H-hope it can help you, Commandant!						
545	3008	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LifuNormal01.png	The day has arrived again, Commandant.		546

560	3011	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	Thank you for your gift, Commandant.		561				
561	3011	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	I don't know why, but every time I watch this movie, it always reminds me of you, Commandant.		562				
562	3011	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	I'll let you have the soundtrack of the movie. And if possible...		563				
563	3011	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	May I ask you to watch the classic scenes in it with me today?						
564	3012	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3BiankaNormal01.png	Thank you for your gift, Commandant.		565				
565	3012	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3BiankaNormal01.png	I don't know why, but every time I watch this movie, it always reminds me of you, Commandant.		566

568	3013	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Ta-da-da! Are you thinking about Nanami, Commandant?		569				
569	3013	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Bingo! Nanami is correct! One point to Nanami!		570				
570	3013	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	To ease Commandant's pain of missing Nanami day and night, Nanami has prepared a special gift for Commandant!		571				
571	3013	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Keep your eyes on me, Commandant!

582	3016	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	I have prepared a special gift for you as well, Commandant! It's the special edition of the game we played together last time!		583				
583	3016	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	It's tons of fun playing games with Commandant! I can't wait any longer!		584

591	3018	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Cough cough... Forget about the dust. Tell me, Commandant, am I the first to communicate with you?		592				
592	3018	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	It doesn't matter even if I'm not the first one, but at least I'm earlier than Lucia, right?		593				
593	3018	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Be patient with me, Commandant. My gift is almost done... What did you say? I didn't hear it! Huh? This is just a small explosion! It's not a big deal!		594				
594	3018	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	My gift is definitely gonna be more breathtaking than Lucia's, no, more breathtaking than anyone else's!

600	3020	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	I've received your gift, Commandant. Long time no see.		601				
601	3020	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	I read your letter and appreciate your concern for the Forsaken.		602				
602	3020	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	Everything is fine at the Oasis. It's just the kids are always asking about you.		603				
603	3020	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	Nights in the desert are dark and long.		604				
604	3020	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	You would have feelings that you never had when looking up at the starry sky.		605				
605	3020	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	If you have time, may I invite you for a visit to the Oasis?						
606	3021	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	I've received your gift, Commandant. Long time no see.		607				
607	3021	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	I read your letter and appreciate your concern for the Forsaken.		608

609	3021	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	Nights in the desert are dark and long.		610

612	3022	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	Happy 520, Commandant!		613				
613	3022	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	It's said that it's a day to express love.		614				
614	3022	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	Although the holiday is said to be a way of marketing originated in the Golden Age, it has already become a part of everyone's life!		615				
615	3022	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	Thank you for the gift, Commandant! In return, I'll let you have the best work of mine!		616				
616	3022	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	Do you like it, Commandant? Because you've got a pretty smile on your face! Yeah, just like that! Cheese! Just look forward to my new work, Commandant!						
617	3023	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	Um... I've been looking for a suitable return gift after receiving your gift.		618				
618	3023	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	But Jamilah told me that a handmade gift is the best way to convey my feelings. Plus, it saves money.		619				
619	3023	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	It's my first time recording a video like this. And I just noticed that there were a lot of things I didn't know about Akdilek.		620				
620	3023	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	Remember to hang out with me if you will visit Akdilek again in the future.						
621	3024	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	Sorry for the late reply. Maybe I tend to think too much like the way I play chess.		622				
622	3024	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	In the end, I realized that I had so many things to tell you that I didn't even know where to start.		623				
623	3024	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	This video records games among chess masters. I often find myself lost in watching it as if I could hear the masters' laughter when they play chess.		624				
624	3024	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	Maybe for them... and for us, chess is a better way of expression than words.						
625	3025	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3kuluomuNormal02.png	Sorry for the late reply. Maybe I tend to think too much like the way I play chess.		626

628	3025	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3kuluomuNormal02.png	Maybe for them... and for us, chess is a better way of expression than words.						
629	3026	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	You won't please me with this, Commandant.		630				
630	3026	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Bring me something more valuable if can, for example...		631				
631	3026	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Huh? Are you asking for a gift from me? Hahaha, I love your stupidity.		632				
632	3026	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	To thank you for making me laugh... I think I'll just give you a little reward in return.		633				
633	3026	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	But I require more in return. You understand me?						
634	3027	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	You won't please me with this, Commandant.		635				
635	3027	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	Bring me something more valuable if can, for example...		636				
636	3027	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	Huh? Are you asking for a gift from me? Hahaha, I love your stupidity.		637

638	3027	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	But I require more in return. You understand me?						
639	3028	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	Greetings, Commandant.		640				
640	3028	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	It's been a long time since I came to Babylonia.		641				
641	3028	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	But sometimes I wonder if there would be a day that we can walk on the white snow, travel under the aurora, and take a simple trip at a silent lake.		642				
642	3028	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	... Perhaps it's not the time to think about the future, but I've prepared a gift.		643				
643	3028	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	Even though I'm not lucky, I still hope that we can make use of this gift in the future.						
644	3032	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Morning, Commandant. Hehe.		645				
645	3032	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Today is an auspicious day. According to the calendar, it's a good day to give gifts!		646				
646	3032	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Do you consider bartering? We're a small business, and I'm an honest businessman...		647				
647	3032	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Don't hang up, Commandant! At least take my gift!		648				
648	3032	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	You scared me, Commandant. I'll be mad at you if your gift is not good enough!						
649	3033	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	... Why are you giving me a gift again?		650				
650	3033	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	This is meaningless, or are you expecting an agent to respond to you?		651				
651	3033	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	Fine. Just this once. I'll give you what you want.						
652	3034	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	Commandant, good morning, or evening.		653				
653	3034	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	Hff... Your gift has woken me up.		654				
654	3034	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	I heard it was a gift from the Gray Raven Commandant and now I'm not sleepy at all.		655				
655	3034	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	What's so special about today?		656				
656	3034	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	Great. I remember you said you sometimes have trouble sleeping.		657				
657	3034	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	Sleeping pills are not good. Take this CD. It will help you with your sleep... I've been wanting to give this to you.		658				
658	3034	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	Come to me any time if it doesn't work. I have many other ways to treat insomnia.						
659	3035	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	No. 21 wants to share something with you, Commandant.		660				
660	3035	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	According to the documentary, animals will share their food with their companions.		661				
661	3035	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	Although this is not food and No. 21 doesn't eat.		662				
662	3035	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	No. 21 wants to share its collection with you.						
663	3036	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Today is the day to exchange gifts, right?		664				
664	3036	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Don't listen to such boring music. It will weaken your mind.		665				
665	3036	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	I'll let you have this. Feel the real rock spirit of the Golden Age.		666				
666	3036	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Classic music in there. Don't lose it. Otherwise...						
667	3037	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	I'm almost used to this new way of celebration.		668				
668	3037	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	You're getting better at picking gifts.		669				
669	3037	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	Good job. "A young man worth teaching" in the old Kowloong language.		670				
670	3037	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	Take this. After feeling the brilliance of Kowloong, you will change your mind and might even carry on Kowloong's will with me.						
671	3038	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	I'm like an alone cloud, floating high above the valleys. Suddenly, I see a sea of flowers. The golden daffodils are in full blossom on the ground...		672				
672	3038	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	This is the first part. How do you like it, Command?		673				
673	3038	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	I added my own melody to it. And the inspiration came from the echoes of the collision between the distant past and the present...		674				
674	3038	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	I hope it can add some colors to this never-ending illusion.						
675	3039	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	I'm like an alone cloud, floating high above the valleys. Suddenly, I see a sea of flowers. The golden daffodils are in full blossom on the ground...		676				
676	3039	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	This is the first part. How do you like it, Command?		677				
677	3039	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	I added my own melody to it. And the inspiration came from the echoes of the collision between the distant past and the present...		678				
678	3039	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	I hope it can add some colors to this never-ending illusion.						
679	3040	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	Oops, sorry, I accidentally pressed the communication button.		680				
680	3040	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	So, are you happy today? My dear Commandant?		681				
681	3040	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	If not, please accept this humble gift Roland prepared for you on this special day.		682				
682	3040	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	Ah, Commandant, did you really prepare a gift for me? This is really... unexpected.		683				
683	3040	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	Well then, according to the etiquette of Babylonia, cough... "I, Roland, would like to thank you for your friendship. I will spare no effort to support your effort to reclaim Earth..."						
684	3041	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	Commandant! Thank you for your gift! Pulao feels sooo happy!		685				
685	3041	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	Actually, I have prepared you a gift as well, Commandant!		686				
686	3041	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	Ta-da! A super interesting anime! I found it on the market! Let's watch it together, Commandant!						
687	3042	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	Gift received from Commandant.		688				
688	3042	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	According to the information in the database, now it's the time to give Commandant a gift in return.		689				
689	3042	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	Gift-picking principle: pick a gift that the recipient likes and reflects the sender's characteristics.		690				
690	3042	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	Gift picked. "Send a gift in return" set as the system's top priority.		691				
691	3042	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	... Yes, even without referring to the data, this is still something... I want to do this moment.						
692	3043	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal03.png	Commandant! Happy 52... Happy holiday!		693				
693	3043	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal03.png	Cough cough... Forget about the dust. Tell me, Commandant, am I the first to communicate with you?		694				
694	3043	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal03.png	It doesn't matter even if I'm not the first one, but at least I'm earlier than Lucia, right?		695				
695	3043	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal03.png	Be patient with me, Commandant. My gift is almost done... What did you say? I didn't hear it! Huh? This is just a small explosion! It's not a big deal!		696				
696	3043	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal03.png	My gift is definitely gonna be more breathtaking than Lucia's, no, more breathtaking than anyone else's!						
697	113	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, Liv reports on duty.		698				
698	113	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	I can't wait to fight alongside with everyone together.						
699	114	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, weapon performance can sometimes be the deciding factor in battle.		700				
700	114	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Therefore, the supply center has prepared a special weapon for you. Please check.						
701	115	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	As battles get more difficult, we need to ensure a steady flow of supplies.		702				
702	115	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Please lead us to acquire the materials we need from different operations.		703				
703	115	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	This will ensure that we have enough resources as our enemies get tougher.		704				
704	115	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Let's do our best together, Commandant! Gray Raven will always be with you!						
705	116	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Good day, Commandant of Gray Ravens. I've got good news for you today.		706				
706	116	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	The combat-assisting drones developed by Babylonia have been officially put into use!		707				
707	116	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	I believe they will be of great help to you in your upcoming battles.						
708	117	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Hey, Commandant of Gray Ravens. How's the mission going?		709				
709	117	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Feeling a little bit lagging behind?		710				
710	117	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Then you might be interested in F.O.S. Military Command College's special collaborative programs for new Commandants.		711				
711	117	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	I believe they'll help you make a giant leap forward.						
712	118	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Now that the world is plagued by the Punishing Virus.		713				
713	118	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	To respond to different crises, we need to gather our power.		714				
714	118	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Only by standing together can we save the world from catastrophe.		715				
715	118	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	More details will be provided when other commandants are present as well.						
9300001	2031	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3kuluomuNormal02.png	On desperate seas long wont to roam... Thy Naiad airs have brought me home, and the grandeur of old Rome.		9300002				
9300002	2031	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3kuluomuNormal02.png	We've trudged through seas and their savage waves, Commandant, and here we are now enjoying ourselves in the sun by the sea. I'm glad we get to spend such a peaceful time together.		9300003				
9300003	2031	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3kuluomuNormal02.png	I hope l will one day be able to give this peaceful sea back to you.						
9600001	96000010	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	*Connection request from Chrome through a private channel*		9600002				
9600002	96000010	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	Commandant, I hope I'm not bothering you.		9600003				
9600003	96000010	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	I've heard that today is the day people express their most heartfelt feelings. I... Strike Hawk has been in your care the whole time, so I would like to express my thanks today.		9600004				
9600004	96000010	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	I have prepared a little something. I hope you'd like it.		9600005				
9600005	96000010	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	I wasn't sure what type of chocolate you might prefer, so I've prepared different types and flavors. I hope you find one that you like.Well, then... Happy Valentine's Day, KURONAME.						
9600006	96000011	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	I heard that today you send your important ones gifts.		9600007				
9600007	96000011	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	And they say this is the most fitting one.		9600008				
9600008	96000011	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	Commandant... Do you like it?						
9600009	96000012	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Hey hey, my little birdling. How's it been? Today's Valentine's, you'd know, won't you?		9600010				
9600010	96000012	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Hah. I know. You're expecting something... special on a day like this, aren'tcha?		9600011				
9600011	96000012	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Something like... This piece of chocolate, a piece that's so sweet that it hurts?		9600012				
9600012	96000012	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Ahaha. Take it. When you pop it in your mouth, don't forget who granted you this pain.						
9600013	96000013	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Finally. Took you long enough. Well, Gray Raven Commandant, you know what day it is.		9600014				
9600014	96000013	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Yep. The day to show your feelings to important ones. Kamui's been nagging me on all day, ignoring the guy wasn't an option.		9600015				
9600015	96000013	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Here. Take this. Guess you'd expected something like this. I've tried several ways of making it and there's been quite a few failed products, but eating them up was kinda fun.		9600016				
9600016	96000013	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Valentine? Nah, I'm not interested in calling it this way or whatever.		9600017				
9600017	96000013	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Unlike that guy, I know what I want. I wouldn't sully such an important matter in such a petty way.						
9600018	2032	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	The sea breeze somehow tastes a little... sweet...		9600019				
9600019	2032	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	Is it because you're standing right beside me? I don't dislike that it's sweet, though.		9600020				
9600020	2032	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	Next time, can we just look at the sea again... Yes, standing.						
9600021	2033	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	I've uploaded the pictures we took at Venus Splash Park. Did you see your face in the pictures?		9600022				
9600022	2033	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	Wait, does it still bother you that I stole that one spoonful of smoothie from you?... Yes, I did it with your spoon. So what?		9600023				
9600023	2033	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	Talking back to me now, huh? Great. I like that.		9600024				
9600024	2033	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	Come over here. I've got you "a little something" to make it up to you. You gotta finish it all, though.						
9600025	2034	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	Hey, how did you like the haunted house, Commandant?		9600026				
9600026	2034	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	That was our first time working together during an escape, wasn't it? We worked so well together, though. It was like...		9600027				
9600027	2034	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	Huh? Did I say something wrong? Hey, I don't know anything.		9600028				
9600028	2034	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	...Well, how about let's do it again?						
9600029	2035	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal04.png	It's quite an experience looking at Venus Splash Park from up above, Commandant.		9600030				
9600030	2035	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal04.png	You can see every inch of it so clearly with nothing standing in the way.		9600031				
9600031	2035	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal04.png	Before I became part of Gray Raven, I never dreamed that I'd one day be able to see this beautiful world this way.						
9600032	2036	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	Tis the time of the year when all flowers shine in bloom—save for the iris.		9600033				
9600033	2036	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	Warmth, sunlight, and rain dew—all these gifts help the seeds and plants get through the excruciating cold of the winter, beyond which they shine in beauty.		9600034				
9600034	2036	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	I heard the day is all about "giving out of love", and I suppose we can't ask for better gifts from these flowers than their beauty and resilience.		9600035				
9600035	2036	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	Do allow me to bring home some fresh flowers for you, Conductor. They might not be the most precious things in the world and they certainly won't last for long, but I hope you will like them all the same.						
9600036	96000030	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	Since you have come to meet me today as promised, I'll hold up my end and give you the deleted footage.		9600037				
9600037	96000030	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	But... you looked tired when you arrived. Are you still this busy lately?		9600038				
9600038	96000030	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	This heap of problems isn't created by one person. Just because they are assigned to you doesn't mean they're your sole responsibility.		9600039				
9600039	96000030	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	Growing up in solitude might bring you merits but also vices... Lean on the people around you a little more, Commandant. Rely on me a little more.						
9600040	96000031	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	Bambinata has received the gift and will pass it to Mistress safely, Commandant... Huh? It's for Bambinata?		9600041				
9600041	96000031	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	Please wait, Commandant. Bambinata is checking the reminder module.		9600042				
9600042	96000031	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	Ah... Today is the day people exchange gifts with those who are important to them. The notification module of Bambinata's reminder system was damaged, and…		9600043				
9600043	96000031	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	…Sincerest apologies, Commandant. Bambinata should have prepared a gift for you on this important day, but Bambinata has forgotten about the promise...		9600044				
9600044	96000031	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	I-if you don't mind, Commandant, Bambinata would love to make it up to you in other ways...						
9600045	96000032	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bakNormal01.png	Thank you for your gift, Commandant.		9600046				
9600046	96000032	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bakNormal01.png	I don't know why, but every time I watch this movie, it always reminds me of you, Commandant.		9600047				
9600047	96000032	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bakNormal01.png	I'll let you have the soundtrack of the movie. And if possible...		9600048				
9600048	96000032	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bakNormal01.png	May I ask you to watch the classic scenes in it with me today?						
9600049	96000033	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V132lNormal01.png	Do you have time at the moment, Commandant?		9600050				
9600050	96000033	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V132lNormal01.png	... Nothing special. It's just I want you to have this tutorial CD.		9600051				
9600051	96000033	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V132lNormal01.png	... Do I know what day today is? Cough, I just randomly grabbed it. It's not something I specially prepared.		9600052				
9600052	96000033	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V132lNormal01.png	Of course this is to prevent you from imposing unreasonable demands on me. I can't conjure up anything out of thin air anytime and anywhere, Commandant.		9600053				
9600053	96000033	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V132lNormal01.png	You didn't answer my question. Do you have time now?		9600054				
9600054	96000033	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V132lNormal01.png	About the weapon extension add-on module you asked about... I researched on it a bit. Find me in the lounge if you still want it.						
9600055	96000034	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200alNormal01.png	Happy White Day! Commandant!		9600056				
9600056	96000034	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200alNormal01.png	Of course I remember this special day! Didn't you take me to Venus Splash Park because of it?		9600057				
9600057	96000034	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200alNormal01.png	I enjoyed spending the day with you, Commandant! The blue ocean, yellow sand, and white clouds... Thank you for gifting me so many colors and inspirations.		9600058				
9600058	96000034	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200alNormal01.png	I've decided to paint everything I saw today on my canvas right now... Of course, the most essential color is you!		9600059				
9600059	96000034	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200alNormal01.png	I wish you could become a color that only I can use all the time. It is said that artists who excel with a color can name it after themselves...		9600060				
9600060	96000034	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200alNormal01.png	But I will give you that right instead. Then, you'll be able to stay on my easel... and with me.						
9600061	96000035	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	Another meaningless gift... You are hopeless.		9600062				
9600062	96000035	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	Alright. I guess I'll have to give you something in return.		9600063				
9600063	96000035	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	I happened to have recorded something boring. Hmm... I think it's okay to let you have a look.		9600064				
9600064	96000035	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	I can get you down here from Babylonia if you want to see it with your own eyes.
