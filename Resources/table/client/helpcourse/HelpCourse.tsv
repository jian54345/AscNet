10010	Project Babel Tower	BabelTower	1. The Project Babel: Maelstrom consists of 3 levels. Each level has only 1 optional stage. In the optional stage, you can freely choose the combination of strategic objectives.\n\n2. Each level can be challenged with up to 3 teams. You can only use the 1st team to attempt each level at the beginning. When the 1st team has a clear record for each level, the 2nd team will be unlocked. When the 2nd team has a clear record for each level, the 3rd team will be unlocked. The record of each team's challenge level and members will be saved separately.\n\n3. Each level contains 5 difficulty levels. Based on your selection, the final Strategic Level will gain different bonuses. Final Strategic Level = Strategic Level Selected x Difficulty Bonus Coefficient (rounded off).\n\n4. There are three parts in the level: [Environmental Intelligence], [Strategic Target] and [Support Module] which will affect the battle\n※Environmental Intelligence: Environmental Affixes in the battle. The challenge of this level will be affected by the Environmental Affixes.\n※Strategic Target: Difficulty Affixes in the battle, the selected Affixes will be added to the level to increase the difficulty.\n※Support Module: Buff Affixes in the battle, the selected Affixes will aid your members in combat.\n\n5. After each successful challenge, the members used will be locked and cannot be used in other levels and form another team. The player can change the status of the members by "Clearing Record" or "Restoring Record".\n※Clearing Record: To clear the Strategic Levels gained by completing the level and unlock the members at the same time.\n※Restoring Record: Restores the level to the state before completion and regains the corresponding Strategic Levels. The members used to complete the level will be locked again.\n\n6. According to the combination of Strategic Objectives selected in the challenge of each level, rewards can be obtained once the total Strategic Level for a single level or the accumulated Strategic Level has reached the requirement of Challenge Mission.\n\n7. Once you complete a level, you will get a collectible reward. The higher the Strategic Level you reach, the better quality the collectible will be.\n\n8. The final Strategic Level reached by all of your teams will be shown on the Babel Tower Ranking.	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiHelp/UiHelpBabelTower01.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiHelp/UiHelpBabelTower02.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiHelp/UiHelpBabelTower03.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiHelp/UiHelpBabelTower04.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiHelp/UiHelpBabelTower05.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiHelp/UiHelpBabelTower06.png

10062	Chestlefield	ChessPursuit	1. "Chestlefield" lasts a total of 5 weeks, with each week being an individual cycle.\n2. There are 2 phases within each cycle. The Practice Phase lasts from Mon to Fri, while the Combat Phase takes place during weekends. Practice Phase consists of 3 games. Commandants only need to defeat the main target to claim the single game rewards. Every game completed during the practice phase will also add tokens to the Combat Phase during the weekend. The Combat Phase consists of two modes, namely the "Generic Operation" and "Elite Operation." There are no single game rewards, but commandants will receive rewards based on the number of attempts taken to defeat the main target.\n3. In every game, commandants need to deploy their forces in the defense facilities first. The main target will move along the map in a certain direction, and engage the defense forces when it passes a defense facility. Every battle has a time limit, and the main target will lose HP based on the battle performance until it eventually dies after several battles.\n4. During the commandant's turn, they can use tokens to purchase and use Tactic Cards to boost the defense forces or control the main target's action.\n5. In Generic Operation, there is a limit on the damage dealt to the main target each time. Outstanding commandants may unlock the "Elite Operation" mode, in which there will be no limit on the damage dealt to the main target each time.\n6. When all the defense facilities have dealt max damage to the main target, commandants may use "Suppress" to immediately defeat it.	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiHelp/UiHelpChessPursuit1.jpg	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiHelp/UiHelpChessPursuit2.jpg	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiHelp/UiHelpChessPursuit3.jpg	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiHelp/UiHelpChessPursuit4.jpg	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiHelp/UiHelpChessPursuit5.jpg	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiHelp/UiHelpChessPursuit6.jpg	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiHelp/UiHelpChessPursuit7.jpg	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiHelp/UiHelpChessPursuit8.jpg
