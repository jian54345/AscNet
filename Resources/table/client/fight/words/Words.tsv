1502040501	4		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	
1502040501	5	Vanessa: Could it be those experimental Constructs on the trees outside?	2	2	2	2	
1502040501	6		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	
1502040501	7	Vera: Playing house here? Unlikely.	2	2	2	2

1502040502	2		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	
1502040502	3	Bambinata: There.	1.5	1.5	1.5	1.5

1502040503	2		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	
1502040503	3	Bambinata: But the layout of the walls here doesn't fully make sense... Not sure if they have been altered before.	3	3	3	3	
1502040503	4		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	
1502040503	5	Vanessa: So they've hidden the tracks of their experiments.	2	2	2	2	
1502040504	1	Vera: ...The door's here. Did you expect me to tell you this?	2	2	2	2	
1502040505	1	Vera: Surveillance? So we've been monitored by someone behind the camera ever since we walked into this place?	3	3	3	3	
1502040506	1	"Vanessa: If there's surveillance equipment, there's a security room storing the footage. The data storage devices must still be running."	3	3	3	3	
1502040506	2		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	
1502040506	3	Vanessa: Let's see if there are any clues to the location of the security room.	2	2	2	2	
1502040507	1	"Vera: Hey, look."	2	2	2	2	
1502040508	1	Vera: These dolls have something in their bellies.	2	2	2	2	
1502040509	1	Vera: The schedule here seems quite healthy.	2	2	2	2	
1502040510	1	Vera: Over here. Has this bear... been here all the time?	2	2	2	2	
1502040511	1		0.75	0.75	0.75	0.75	100000928
1502040511	2	???: ...Come on.	2	2	2	2	
1502040512	1	"Vera: Hey, stop zoning out, dollface!"	2	2	2	2	
1502040513	1	Bambinata: The security room is in there.	2	2	2	2	
1502040514	1	Vera: Behind the shelf? How did you know that?	2	2	2	2	
1502040515	1	Bambinata: There is a strange memory... in Bambinata's M.I.N.D.	2.5	2.5	2.5	2.5	
1502040515	2		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5

1502040515	7	Vanessa: Let's see if there's anything unusual about this bookshelf first.	2	2	2	2	
1502040516	1	"Bambinata: Do we blow this place up, Mistress?"	2	2	2	2	
1502040516	2		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	
1502040516	3	Vanessa: Let's avoid impacting the electronics and data with the explosions. We'll start with scanning it.	2	2	2	2	
1502040517	1	"Vera: The shelf has electrical reactions as expected, but the activation requires admin authentication."	2	2	2	2	
1502040518	1	Vera: Can we find it in the memory?	2	2	2	2	
1502040519	1	Bambinata: Hmm... The data is not complete. Let Bambinata try to fix it.	3	3	3	3	
1502040520	1	"Vanessa: Wait, let's be more careful. Establish a deep M.I.N.D. connection with me first, Bambinata."	3	3	3	3	
1502040521	1	"Vanessa: And Cerberus, you keep an eye on things and help out Bambinata."	2	2	2	2	
1502040523	1	Bambinata: Broken memory data... Should be able to make it more consistent if Bambinata can adjust the time perception.	3	3	3	3	
1502040523	2		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	
1502040523	3	Bambinata: The core data that appears to be the administrator is standing by the bed. Is it time to rest?	2	2	2	2

1502040525	1	Bambinata: ...	2	2	2	2	
1502040526	1	"Bambinata: The same wooden horse... This memory must have taken place before the game time, I guess?"	3	3	3	3	
1502040527	1	Bambinata: Something is missing... Mistress should be able to find it.	3	3	3	3	
1502040528	1	Bambinata: The time of the memory is not accurate enough.	3	3	3	3	
1502040529	1	Bambinata: Something is missing... Mistress should be able to find it.	3	3	3	3	
1502040530	1	"Mother: Good children, tidy up toys. Otherwise, you'll become, naughty children."	2	2	2	2	
1502040530	2		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	
1502040530	3	"Mother: Naughty children, will be, punished."	2	2	2	2	
1502040531	1	Bambinata: These memories... Is this where Bambinata used to live?	2	2	2	2	
1502040532	1	"Mother: Game time, now. Good children, make use of, calculation module."	3	3	3	3	
1502040533	1	Bambinata: Mistress never told Bambinata about her past.	3	3	3	3	
1502040534	1	Vera: Hmm? Did I touch something by mistake? Sorry—	3	3	3	3	
1502040534	2		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	
1502040534	3	Vera: But you should stay lying down!	2	2	2	2	
1502040535	1	Bambinata: Resume data recovery.	2	2	2	2	
1502040536	1	"Vera: Looks like someone's keeping a secret from you, dollface."	2	2	2	2	
1502040537	1	Vera: All eliminated.	2	2	2	2	
1502040538	1	Vera: That's it?	1.5	1.5	1.5	1.5	
1502040538	2		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5

1502040540	3	"Bambinata: Yes, Mistress."	1.5	1.5	1.5	1.5	
1502040539	1	Vanessa: They look... more like they're running out from inside.	2	2	2	2	
1502040539	2		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	
1502040539	3	Vera: There seems to be something here that scares them.	1.5	1.5	1.5	1.5	
1502040541	1	Vera:Hm? It seems that I still have to adjust the clock.	2.5	2.5	2.5	2.5	
1502040601	1	Vera: The terminal only has the data track of the surveillance record. Someone has modified it.	2	2	2	2	
1502040602	1	Vanessa: There has to be something related to the experiment. Look deeper.	2	2	2	2	
1502040603	1	Bambinata: Bambinata can try to fix these data fragments like she did earlier.	3	3	3	3	
1502040604	1	Vera: With your external memory module?	3	3	3	3	
1502040605	1	"Vanessa: Bambinata, stop if any error occurs."	3	3	3	3

1502040608	1	Vera: What? The data download panel is over there.	3	3	3	3	
1502040609	1	Bambinata: I must not leave without Mistress' permission.	2	2	2	2	
1502040610	1	Bambinata: Successfully entered the recovery space.	2	2	2	2	
1502040611	1	Vanessa: Look for anything related to the experiment or architectural blueprints.	3	3	3	3	
1502040612	1	Bambinata: Understood.	1.5	1.5	1.5	1.5	
1502040613	1	Bambinata: Space recovery interrupted... Could there be a data deviation?	3	3	3	3	
1502040614	1	"Bambinata: The recovered security room might have the information you need, Mistress... It's straight ahead."	3	3	3	3	
1502040615	1	Bambinata: What just flashed before me...?	2	2	2	2	
1502040616	1		3	3	3	3	
1502040617	1	Bambinata: It shouldn't be here. Looks like the items have to be matched with the correct data.	3	3	3	3	
1502040618	1	Bambinata: The data deviation is down.	2	2	2	2	
1502040619	1	"Bambinata: Data deviation corrected, Mistress. Bambinata is off to the next area."	3	3	3	3

1502040630	2	???: ...Come on.	2	2	2	2	
1502040631	1	Bambinata: What are these...? Should they be in the data fragments by default?	2	2	2	2	
1502040632	1		2	2	2	2	
1502040633	1	Bambinata: This is... an abnormal data fragment?	2	2	2	2	
1502040634	1	Bambinata: It turns out that these data fragments are their memories...	2	2	2	2	
1502040635	1	Bambinata: Who are you? Did you interrupt the communication between Bambinata and Mistress?	2	2	2	2	
1502040636	1	Bambinata: The words on the barque... Should be left by the friend of the constructor of this building.	3	3	3	3

1502040642	1	Bambinata: ...	2	2	2	2	
1502040643	1	Bambinata: The security room. Found it.	1.5	1.5	1.5	1.5	
1502040644	1	Bambinata: Who's there!	1	1	1	1	
1502040645	1	Bambinata: The security room... is not this way.	2	2	2	2	
1502040646	1	Vera: Dollface said it was not this way.	2	2	2	2	
1502040301	1	Vera: This is the best you can do? Useless.	2	2	2	2	
1502040302	1	"Vera: By the time you finish, I would have killed all the enemies here, dear."	2	2	2	2	
1502040303	1	Vanessa: Lower your voice. Don't draw other Corrupted here. They'll slow us down.	2	2	2	2	
1502040304	1	"Vera: Turns out that wherever I go, the battlefield always follows!"	2	2	2	2	
1502040305	1	"Vera: Hey, you can handle this, right? Little girl?"	2	2	2	2	
1502040306	1	Bambinata: Yes. Combat order received from Mistress. Ready to fight at any minute.	2	2	2	2	
1502040307	1	Vera: You guys suck.	2	2	2	2	
1502040308	1	Vera: You're acting like this is your first mission!	2	2	2	2	
1502040309	1	"Vera: Let me help you. Otherwise, I don't know when we can complete the mission."	2	2	2	2	
1502040310	1	Vanessa: The mist is heavy.	2	2	2	2	
1502040311	1	"Bambinata: High percentage of sulfides, but lower than the harmful range."	3	3	3	3	
1502040312	1	"Vera: Something's on the tree. Is it a Corrupted? No, the degree of corrosion is not right..."	2	2	2	2	
1502040313	1	"Vanessa: Bambinata, check with the terminal."	2	2	2	2	
1502040314	1	"Bambinata: Yes, Mistress."	2	2	2	2	
1502040315	1	Bambinata: ...It's a broken experimental Construct. The module is not available now.	3	3	3	3	
1502040316	1	Vanessa: This place looks like their cemetery...	2	2	2	2	
1502040317	1	Vanessa: Stay alert. We haven't finished all the enemies.	2	2	2	2	
1502040318	1	Bambinata: ...Synchronizing kinetic module parameters...	2	2	2	2	
1502040319	1	Bambinata: Synchronizing resimulated special attack moves...	2	2	2	2	
1502040801	1	"Vera: Hmph, a welcome party like this..."	2	2	2	2	
1502040802	1	Vera: Trying to stall for time?	2	2	2	2	
1502040803	1	Vera: Is this place constructed just to play them around? This is too narrow.	2	2	2	2	
1502040804	1	Vera: Have to slow down.	2	2	2	2	
1502040805	1	Vera: Footsteps...	3	3	3	3	
1502040806	1	"Vera: Let's have fun, shall we?"	3	3	3	3	
1502040807	1	Vera: I hear footsteps. I'm not here to play this boring game with you.	2	2	2	2	
1502041101	1	???: ...	2	2	2	2	
1502041101	2	"???: Oh... Mother, give me one more chance..."	3	3	3	3	
1502041101	3	I will convince Doris to behave!	3	3	3	3	
1502041110	1	Wake up—	1	1	1	1	
1502041111	1	Bambinata...	1	1	1	1	
1502041112	1	Bambi... nata...	1	1	1	1	
1502041113	1	Bam... bi...	1	1	1	1	
1502041114	1	Hurry up—	1	1	1	1	
1502041115	1	"Dottie: Doris, Mother's getting angry."	2	2	2	2	
1502041116	1	Stop being selfish.	4	4	4	4	
1502041117	1	We can't let Mother down again.	4	4	4	4	
1502041118	1	You must learn this immediately.	3	3	3	3	
1502041119	1	Be a good girl!	4	4	4	4	
1502041120	1	"Doris, be good."	2	2	2	2	
1502041121	1	"Family, Dottie, family, Mother"	2	2	2	2	
1502041122	1	"Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother"	2	2	2	2	
1502041123	1	"Family, family, family, family"	2	2	2	2	
1502041124	1	"Doris, be good. Good girl."	2	2	2	2	
1502041125	1	"Good girl, be good."	2	2	2	2	
1502041126	1	"Behave, behave, behave, behave"	2	2	2	2	
1502041127	1	"...Yes, it's easy to follow orders."	8	8	8	8	100000908
1502041128	1	No... Someone will hate Bambinata for this.	6.5	6.5	6.5	6.5	100000909
1502041129	1	Be a good kid. The researcher also said this to Bambinata...	5.5	5.5	5.5	5.5	100000910
1502041130	1	"But, Bambinata also has something to say... May she?"	8.5	8.5	8.5	8.5	100000911
1502041131	1	Wanting to do it does not make it right.	6	6	6	6	100000912
1502041132	1	...Is that so? How can Bambinata tell right from wrong?	8	8	8	8	100000913
1502041133	1	"If silence is the worst answer, then what is the correct answer?"	6	6	6	6	100000914
1502041134	1	The answer to what?	3	3	3	3	100000915
1502041135	1	The answer to... her expectation—	4	4	4	4	100000916
1502041136	1	Why didn't you say you like ballet?	5	5	5	5	100000925
1502041137	1	Bambinata... Will you support me?	5	5	5	5	100000926
1502041138	1	"One day, I will make it so that no one disobeys me."	7	7	7	7	100000927
1502041139	1	Bambinata must tell Nessa... Mistress what she's been <//WANTING> to say!	8	8	8	8	100000917
1502041140	1	Even against Mother and Father's order?	5	5	5	5	100000918
1502041141	1	Yes. This is what Bambinata wants to do.	7	7	7	7	100000919
1502041142	1	Understood.	4	4	4	4	100000920
1502041143	1	"Then, Bambinata has to get back to Nessa (Mistress) now."	7	7	7	7	100000921
1502041144	1	Dottie: No!	3	3	3	3	
1502041145	1	Dottie: Hahaha—Mother will punish you...	3	3	3	3	
1502041146	1	"Bambinata: Bambinata will be right back to you, Mistress."	3	3	3	3	
1502041147	1	Mother: ...	4	4	4	4	
1502041148	1	A black... butterfly?	5	5	5	5	
1502041149	1	It flew away... Should Bambinata follow it?	5	5	5	5	
1502041150	1	Haven't you felt the love from Mother?	4	4	4	4	
1502041151	1	Bambinata: ...Who's there?	3	3	3	3	
1502041152	1	Bambinata: First priority is to get out of here.	4	4	4	4	
1502041153	1	Mother: ...	3	3	3	3	
1021011800	1	The rising platform is like a lonely boat on the endless river.	3	3	3	3	
1021011800	2	Strange sights are devouring the edges of the M.I.N.D.	6	6	6	6	
1021011800	3	He must think of a way to tackle everything here.	6	6	6	6	
1021011801	1	(Weird screams)	3	3	3	3	
1021011802	1	"Lee?: Since we don't belong to the same world, I can't share much with you."	3	3	3	3	
1021011802	2	Lee?: I can't promise that what I've learned will apply to your situation.	3	3	3	3	
1021011803	1	Lee?: Too much information may lead to more errors.	3	3	3	3	
1021011803	2	"Lee?: Trying to ""fix"" things arbitrarily might cause more problems. I'm sure you understand that."	3	3	3	3	
1021011804	1	"Lee?: You must find your own answer, the most important part."	3	3	3	3	
1021011804	2	Lee?: Its clues can be anywhere.	4	4	4	4	
1021011805	1	Lee?: ...I'll leave the rest to you. Only you can do this.	5	5	5	5	
1021021800	1	Back to this place again...	6	6	6	6	
1021021800	2	But the answer to the unending corridor has been solved.	6	6	6	6	
1021021800	3	The only thing remaining is to reach the top of the tower.	6	6	6	6	
1021012000	1	"The heavy fog is gone, and they finally reached the end of the river..."	6	6	6	6	
1021012001	1	Scarlet data is flowing slowly on the dense sharp crystal spikes.	6	6	6	6	
1021012002	1	The platform broke into the weird space without invitation.	6	6	6	6	
1021022000	1	"Familiar place, strange barrier."	3	3	3	3	
1021022001	1	Lee stands here once again after going through countless difficulties...	5	5	5	5	
1021022002	1	Possibilities from other timelines have entered Hyperreal's body...	5	5	5	5	
1021022003	1	"Attracted by the core, the guards of the ""tower"" are emerging from the time rifts."	3	3	3	3	
1021022004	1	Possibilities from other timelines have merged in Hyperreal's body.	5	5	5	5	
1021022005	1	Lee is back to this place again... but will he be able to face the core this time?	6	6	6	6	
1021011900	1	A few hours after saving Liv...	6	6	6	6	
1021011901	1	Lee is out on a walk but still can't quiet his mind...	6	6	6	6	
1021011902	1	Hm? Is it raining?	4	4	4	4	
1021011903	1	Brother... Brother...	3	3	3	3	
1021011904	1	Where is my brother...?	3	3	3	3	
1021011905	1	Warning! Warning! Noncombatant personnel please take refugee immediately!	5	5	5	5	
1021011906	1	The quiet vibration has brought a slight change to the converging strings of fate...	5	5	5	5	
1021012201	1	This time... my bullets will definitely reach you.	3	3	3	3	
1021012201	2	And they will shatter your laughable imitations!	3	3	3	3	
1021012202	1	Hmph. Your imitation ability is just as I calculated.	2	2	2	2	
1021012203	1		0.75	0.75	0.75	0.75	100000929
1021012203	2	"You've been learning, comprehending, and imitating us."	5	5	5	5	
1021012203	3	Our response is to keep going and reach places you will never reach.	10	10	10	10	
1021012100	1	A storm struck the M.I.N.D...	6	6	6	6	
1021012101	1	But an area remains silent in the chaos.	6	6	6	6	
1021012102	1	"No other ""Lees"" can be found here..."	6	6	6	6	
1021012103	1	"The memory resonates with the ""Whirlpool"". The memory deep in the M.I.N.D. starts surging..."	6	6	6	6	
1021012104	1	—The clock hands start to move backward.	5	5	5	5	
1021012105	1	—The clock hands start to move forward.	5	5	5	5	
1021012106	1	???: The answer is not here. You failed. We all failed...	5	5	5	5	
1021012107	1	Attempt 231... I saw... the broken wings... and the feathers fell into the snow and mud...	5	5	5	5	
1021012108	1	...Waiting for the moment... to reach the unopened door... after the death of humans.	5	5	5	5	
1021012109	1	...Tell me your answer.	5	5	5	5	
1021012110	1	The hidden memories resonate once more.	3	3	3	3	
1021012111	1	The start of resolve. The desired future. Everything comes together once again.	6	6	6	6	
1021012112	1	"But we have no choice but to move on, right...?"	5	5	5	5	
1021012113	1	"Me on the other side, with the <//PROSPECTS> of a brand-new frame."	4	4	4	4	
1021012114	1	Hold it tight and keep going...	4	4	4	4	
1021012115	1	The future... is in your hand...	6	6	6	6	
300613041	1	System: Low energy of the frame. Exiting flying mode and entering the lower-power mode.	3.5	3.5	3.5	3.5	
300613042	1	Trailblazer: Looks like it's impossible to fly long distance.	2	2	2	2	
300613043	1	Trailblazer: It seems we have to reach the target point from ground.	2	2	2	2	
300613044	1	Trailblazer: Let's check the frame before action.	2	2	2	2	
300613045	1	System: Logic module protocol is active. Logic circuit is running properly.	2	2	2	2	
300613046	1	System: Weapon module protocol not enabled.	2	2	2	2

300613040	1	System: Exiting the low-power mode and restarting the battle mode.	2	2	2	2	
300613050	1	Trailblazer: The frame has mostly recovered. Now we can move to the target point.	2	2	2	2	
300613051	1	Patrol Robot: Unknown object detected. Execute the elimination order.	3	3	3	3	
300613052	1	Trailblazer: That's the target.	2	2	2	2	
300613053	1	Trailblazer: Execute the last recycle operation.	2	2	2	2	
300613060	1	Trailblazer: That is our target.	2	2	2	2	
300613061	1	Trailblazer: Looks like it's a data transfer device for a prototype frame.	2	2	2	2	
300613062	1	Trailblazer: Modify its command data and then turn it on to control it.	2	2	2	2	
300613071	1	Trailblazer: It's locked by a device nearby. Data already backed up in the "Battle Mode" database.	3	3	3	3	
300613111	1	Trailblazer: Looks like it will land at the dock on the east very soon.	2	2	2	2	
300613112	1	Trailblazer: I should get moving as well.	2	2	2	2	
300613113	1	Trailblazer: And I'll be after it.	2	2	2	2	
300613114	1	Trailblazer: At least there is still some left.	2	2	2	2	
300613141	1	Trailblazer: I knew it. The locking alarm was triggered.	2	2	2	2	
300613142	1	Trailblazer: Operating device activated. Data already backed up in the "Battle Mode" database.	2	2	2	2

300613146	1	Trailblazer: Not this one!	2	2	2	2	
1022011301	1	If the actor can be fully indulged in the play, then the stage would be larger than what meets the eye.	3	3	3	3	
1022011302	1	When the actor becomes the character themselves, they can see the real world through other things and acquire the necessary experience as the character.	4	4	4	4	
1022011303	1	However, when the bell toll comes and the play is over, the character has to remove the costume and back to the normal actor.	3	3	3	3	
1022011304	1	If you were the character, how would you decide how the play starts and ends?	2	2	2	2	
1022011307	1	Oh, I guess that's the "giant's wings" in the knight. Huh? Is it spinning faster?	2	2	2	2	
1022011308	1	Ayla: Mask? It went through...	2	2	2	2	
1022011310	1	Don Quixote: A true warrior will never surrender!	2	2	2	2	
1022011311	1	Don Quixote: I can definitely defeat you!	2	2	2	2	
1022021301	1	Don Quixote: Did you defeat that Don Quixote, my lord? Unbelievable!	3	3	3	3	
1022021302	1	Mirror Knight: You'll understand soon!	2	2	2	2	
1022021303	1	Don Quixote: The Don Quixote you mentioned is my best friend in this world. You could say that I'm just like him.	4	4	4	4	
1022021310	1	Mirror Knight: Cough... If I can defeat him, then I can defeat you!	2	2	2	2	
1022021311	1	Mirror Knight: Now it's your turn to feel hopeless.	2	2	2	2	
1022031301	1	Don Quixote: Whitemoon Knight, I've never heard of your achievements, but I decide to accept your challenge anyway.	2	2	2	2	
1022031302	1	Don Quixote: But I don't want your achievements for I have mine.	2	2	2	2	
1022031303	1	Whitemoon Knight: Well then, let's start the challenge.	2	2	2	2	
1022031305	1	Whitemoon Knight: ...	2	2	2	2	
1022031306	1	Whitemoon Knight: The greatest knight in the world indeed! Now I'll break your sword myself!	2	2	2	2	
1022031307	1	Don Quixote: ...Is this the power of a wizard?	2	2	2	2	
1022031310	1	Whitemoon Knight: Our decisions are incompatible.	2	2	2	2	
1022031311	1	Whitemoon Knight: The world we see is different.	2	2	2	2	
1022031312	1	Don Quixote: No. I just followed the truth as I saw it.	2	2	2	2	
1022031315	1	Whitemoon Knight: Truth? What truth?	2	2	2	2	
1022031316	1	Whitemoon Knight: If you continue to do this, you will fall in the abyss of your illusions.	2	2	2	2	
1022010901	1	Troian: Ayla, pay attention to the surroundings. No idea what kind of "design" will be waiting ahead for us in the hall.	2	2	2	2	
1022010902	1	Ayla: "Design"...? Probably we are also part of it.	2	2	2	2	
1022010903	1	Troian: ...I knew it! Be careful. This is not a simple "exhibition."	2	2	2	2	
1022010905	1	Troian: We are safe. I'll put away my weapon!	2	2	2	2	
1022010906	1	Smart Projection: Scanning your traits and generating a description of you in ancient Kowloong language. Please stay still.	4	4	4	4	
1022010907	1	Smart Projection: Abnormal visitor behavior. Defense program activated.	3	3	3	3	
1022010908	1	Ayla: Wait! That's not what I meant!	2	2	2	2	
1022010909	1	Troian: I'll continue to set up the turret.	2	2	2	2	
1022020901	1	Ayla: There should be two lines!	2	2	2	2	
1022020902	1	Ayla: Because Ayla seems to have participated in this!	2	2	2	2	
1022020905	1	Sica: ...Huh? Wait! Miss Ayla. Miss Troian. Can you hear me?	2	2	2	2	
1022020906	1	Sica: We just severely injured "Huaxu", and he is back to battle mode already?	2	2	2	2	
1022020907	1	Sica & Ayla: ...Now!	2	2	2	2	
1022020910	1	Sica: That's alright! Now that we know their tricks, we just need to play with it patiently...	3	3	3	3	
1022020915	1	Sica: Yes!	3	3	3	3	
1022020601	1	Sica: The guy over there...	3	3	3	3	
1022020602	1	Ayla: Speaking of the Arctic Route Union...	4	4	4	4	
1022020603	1	Ayla: All right! Let's start the boss fight!	2	2	2	2	
1022010601	1	Guide: Please follow me.	3	3	3	3	
1022010602	1	Sica: A hall in the Arctic Route Union's style... Bigger than I expected.	4	4	4	4	
1022010603	1	Troian: Stay sharp.	4	4	4	4	
1022010604	1	Ayla: Let's just follow it.	4	4	4	4	
1022010605	1	Guide: Welcome to the arctic hall. Before we start to explore, I'd like to ask you to do a little test for me.	6	6	6	6	
1022010606	1	Guide: The Arctic Circle, the pole of Earth, the coldest place, and yet humans never give up exploring it.	6	6	6	6	
1022010607	1	Guide: In the Golden Age, the Arctic Route Union completely conquered it. And I... want to reproduce their persistence and struggle here and observe. To live like they once did and survive despite the hardship.	6	6	6	6
