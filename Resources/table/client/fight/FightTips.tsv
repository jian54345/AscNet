11150433	1		Of course they did. Those rules are...			
11150434	1		Colder than seawater, harder than icebergs.			
11150435	1		Calorie intake is limited to 1,164 kcals per day. These are your rations for today.			
11150436	1		Children are treated as adults without any special privileges.			
11150437	1		The book says that people will die from hunger if they have nothing to eat.			
11150438	1		When many people die from hunger at once, it's called a famine.			
11150439	1		Am I going to die from hunger?			
11150440	1		The book also says the world outside Atlantis is much bigger.

11150443	1		Compared with land, Atlantis is only a grain of dust.			
11150444	1		There are many, many Atlantis on land with many, many people living inside.			
11150446	1		Unlike Atlantis, they don't have stacks of rules on land.

11150666	1		And her condition?

140290101	5	Construct Kane's Record	I think you were right, sister. I should've given it more thought before taking the operation to become a Construct. But at that time months ago, I only wanted an escape from the fact that I could no longer paint. I'd rather choose another path than exist as a human who couldn't hold a pen properly due to hand disability. I don't regret my choice. But... There's something I do regret. If I hadn't left out of spite, I might have gotten WGAA's approval of my application. Although it was not my intention to become a soldier, the troop I'm in is mostly made up of rookies, so we are stationing safer areas in most cases. I also have time to paint every after the shift. (I haven't finished it, but I can bring it to you when you're free next time.)\nSorry for not writing to you for a long time. I know that you've been asking people about me.\n...It's my shift. I'll end it here. I promise to write more. Sorry. Miss you!\n...\n...\n(The rest of the audio is full of noise. Maybe someone accidentally pressed the record button in battle. Some information about the battle could be restored through analysis.)

I know that captain and the two seniors don't want me to risk it on the frontline because I'm new, but I want to be useful! Damn! Snipping minions once in a while in the floating car is not the ground mission I expected.\n...\n\nRecord 18\n\nThe mission was carried out smoothly and was about to end. Captain and the others read my logs. They rubbed my hair and laughed a long time. Well, it seems there's no chance to make any great contribution this time...\n...\n\nRecord 26\n\nThey live under the ventilation duct! The number of enemies is twice, no, three times, as we expected! Captain is injured. We have to leave immediately!\n...\n\nRecord 30\n\nThey are coming from all directions. Did they deliberately hide themselves for us to reach the ventilation duct? No... They can't be this smart! It's impossible! Captain's injury seems serious... I just checked. There isn't much fuel left in the vehicle... We took a detour to break their siege. According to the plan, we should have been on our way back home at this time...\n\nRecord 31\n\nWe are now hiding between two solar panels. Everyone has run out of ammo. Guns have become clumsy cold weapons. Captain asked us to get rid of everything except medicine and fuel. Our chance to withdraw would be small if we fail to get our vehicle moving, so we have to reduce the load. Next, we are gonna rush out. Hope it will work... Damn... My hands... Just stop shaking...\n\nRecord 32\n\nThey found us. We spent a lot more fuel to get rid of them... Is there really nothing we can do this time?\n\nRecord 33\n\n...\n\nCaptain jumped... I saw him falling into the enemies with my own eyes...\n\nRecord 34\n\nWe sniped the illumination system with the vehicle and finally reached the exit as planned. But... There are too many of them... Zod seems lost ever since we lost captain. Now Lin is in charge.\n\nRecord 35\n\nThe sun is up... but Zod is not on the vehicle...\n...\nEven Lin fails to force a smile as he always managed to when he tried to encourage us.\n\nRecord 36\n\nWe decided to try if we can break the doom and leave from there. But... Is this transparent doom really as fragile and breakable as the glass?\n\nRecord 37\n\n...\nWould we all have lived if captain were still here?\nWould none of this have happened if I had treated the mission more seriously?\nIf only... I were the one who died...

1023011261	5	News Archive A21654211	Jul 13, the contract plan of human experiment on death-row prisoners has been terminated officially.\nThe plan approved by the World Government has been around for three years. Originally, it was a charity contract signed by the prisoner and their family voluntarily for the prisoner to assist in the medical experiment after receiving compensation.\nHowever, this year, it was revealed that the related institutes had "borrowed" the prisoners secretly to carry out inhuman experiments in the name of the World Government without their agreement.\nAfter that, people started a mass protest against the plan. Three days later, the plan was completely halted. Human experiments were once again listed as an illegal operation.
