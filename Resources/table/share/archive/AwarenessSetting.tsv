Over the years, two relatively reasonable speculations emerged. The first suggests that Turing's experiments had in fact achieved more than satisfactory results, but he refused to submit them for his own consideration or other "ethical" reasons, leading to his "disposal." The second is that Turing's death itself was a well-designed "experiment." In order to explore the future of computer AI and human intelligence, this genius chose to use himself as the subject. Regardless of the true cause, even in his demise, Turing's memory data continues to influence the cutting-edge research in relevant fields.	811006
