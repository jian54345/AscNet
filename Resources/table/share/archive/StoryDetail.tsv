100705	1007	5	Split	7_5			Without a trace of Kamui, Karenina quietly left the team.	84100705		ZX00705BA	ZX00705EA

100907	1009	7	Strict Education	9_7			This high-density body plans to give Gray Raven a lesson.	84100907		ZX00907BA	
100908	1009	8	Gravitational Edge	9_8			The Prism is now ready.	84100908		ZX00908BA

601904	6019	4	SP-04	Ⅰ			Even in the data form, no team member should be left behind. That's what we call an ideal victory.	84600353	2020/9/10 5:02	ZZ00104BA

601912	6019	12	SP-04	Ⅲ			You finally completed the test mission, but the system AI had an error.	84600361	2020/9/24 5:02	ZZ00112BA	
601913	6019	13	SP-01	Ⅳ			Your mind was trapped within Virtual Horizon. The AI that had been guiding you told you her name was "Ann." She hoped you could stay and fight forever.	84600362	2020/10/1 5:02	ZZ00113BA	
601914	6019	14	SP-02	Ⅳ			Ann was attacked by a monster that resembled Amberia. She then realized she was only Amberia's backup persona. Just when she was about to be devoured, the Construct she created saved her.	84600363	2020/10/1 5:02	ZZ00114BA	
601915	6019	15	SP-03	Ⅳ			Ann wanted to break free from the system, but the only way out was to defeat the monster "Amberia." She and all the Constructs would help you.	84600364	2020/10/1 5:02	ZZ00115BA	
601916	6019	16	SP-04	Ⅳ			Finally, you defeated the monster, but everything would soon be forgotten when you wake up, and Ann fell into an eternal sleep once again.	84600365	2020/10/1 5:02	ZZ00116BA
