1010103208	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Cathy	1	Odd. Shark-speare was here playing music games. Was she inspired by King Wrench XIV?	3
1010103209	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Cathy	1	She must have left these tracks while playing with the balloon.	3
1010103210	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Cathy	1	This must be the skateboard Shark-speare used!	3

101103005	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	It should be an amplifier. Or at least one of its functions is to amplify signals.	
101103006	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	...The low-level design of the device is identical to the ship's system. Might have slight differences, but I can't tell yet.

102010202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But... Corrupted are still converging en masse.	
102010203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	No doubt driven in this direction by the Iso-Devices of other teams.

102010205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We'll have to hurry... We need to clear out this zone so we can deploy the device.

102010302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	And during so, we'll have to draw the enemy away, right?

102010305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	That went well. The Iso-Device is humming along nicely.

102030408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The wound is worsening... Just leave me here. I'll just slow you down.	
102030409	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Recalling is the safest choice for me now. It will only cause the faintest ripple in my M.I.N.D.	
102030410	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Lee, please! Stop!	
102030411	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'll get you back, no matter what!	
102040101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	……	
102040102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I'm worried that the new variants will start targeting Iso-Devices.	
102040103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We should investigate, Commandant.	
102040104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Already sent someone, huh.	
102040201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	There's too much debris. Is there another way?	
102040202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This is the last exit. All the others have collapsed.	
102040203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	There's no choice, Commandant. We'll have to slowly remove the debris.	
102040301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	You will all be specimens of my next experiment!	
102040302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Don't hesitate just because she was a Construct!	
102040303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Do... Do we destroy her?!	
102040304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...Yes.	
102040305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Impossible! How are you so strong?!	
102040306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	A Construct without their Commandant is no match for us!	
102040307	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	I can't let the Princess down...	
102040308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Princess?	
102040401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant, let's use the fog to sneak back upstairs.	
102040402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This enemy is bad news... Sorry. I'm being a liability.	
102040403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	No, Lee... You're not.	
102040404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'm the one who got us into this mess...	
102040405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	(Coughs) It's getting worse... Just put me down...	
102040406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Stuff it already, Lee!	
102040407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	……!?	
102040408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'll bring you back, no matter what!	
102040409	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Liv...	
102040410	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	...Alright, then I'll be counting on you.	
102040411	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Corrupted are closing in. We need to hurry.	
103010101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	Kamui, what's your status?	
103010102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Uh, Chrome... I think I'm lost.	
103010103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	Just as I thought...	
103010104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	You're good in a fight, but your sense of direction is appalling...	
103010105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	Listen up, Kamui, just follow the Navi-Path...	
103010106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Navi? I told you, that thing is useless. It keeps changing directions! It's so annoying...!	
103010107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	Because it detects threats in real-time and adjusts your route accordingly. The Strike Hawks fight alone, after all.	
103010108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I've got my instincts! I don't need a Navi to tell me where the danger is!	
103010109	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hang on. There's a Construct up ahead. I'll go ask him the way!	
103010110	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	But there are no friendly signals in your vicinity. Hey! Can you still hear me?	
103010111	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	You here on a mission too? Well, ain't that a coincidence!	
103010112	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	……	
103010113	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Yes. Quite.	
103010114	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I'm looking for the Estate Museum. On my way to reinforce the Gray Raven. Can you point me in the right direction?	
103010115	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	That way.	
103010116	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Oh, it's that way... Guess my Navi was right, after all. Good luck on your mission too, friend!	
103010117	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Don't mention it.	
103010118	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Well, well. They do have some interesting people on their side, don't they?	
103010201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	This is where the distress signal originated.	
103010202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	High Construct casualties, but low levels of Punishing Virus...	
103010203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Thankfully, they all recalled their consciousnesses. Their bodies weren't further infected as well.	
103010204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We should do some preliminary recovery, and find out what happened while we're at it.	
103010205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	They are covered in gunshot wounds.	
103010206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Whatever did this is packing some serious heat. Be on your guard.	
103010207	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Look!	
103010208	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongganrantiNomal01.png	Heavy Terrapod	1	Visitor Identification: Thug. Commence program, "Civil Control".	
103010209	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's... one of the Estate Terrapods. Someone must have reactivated it.	
103010210	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	How many guns did they cram in this thing? Post-Pandemic Age tech really could use some subtlety...	
103010211	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv, request backup from nearby team.	
103010212	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Okay!	
103010301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Leave these to me!	
103010302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Easy!	
103010303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Wow, he must be a Tank Construct... That onslaught didn't leave a scratch on him.	
103010304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	(Chuckles)	
103010401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The Estate structures are falling apart, but their control systems seem pretty much intact.	
103010402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The Estate control systems can be accessed via that Terminal. If we can hack the defense codes, we can shut the systems down.	
103010403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Is that a bionic animal? Cooool!	
103010404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Wow! It's moving!	
103010405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	You—	
103010406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	He's activated the entire museum security system! And it's at the highest alert! That idiot...	
103020101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	These exhibits... look super shady...	
103020102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	But I won't touch them again, I swear!	
103020103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Locked... Tch, of course.	
103020104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Enemies behind us are closing in!	
103020105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	No good way around this. Let's deal with them first.	
103020106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown01.png	???	1	That's far enough. Please leave this place, while you still can.	
103020107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Who... said that?	
103020201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The... the exhibits are being activated!	
103020202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Turn on EM Camo, quickly.	
103020203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The Beamers ahead are hidden behind a force field. Our attacks will bounce right off.	
103020204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We'll have to observe their attacks and time our exit carefully. Remember, any hits will disable our EM Camo.	
103020205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Door locks disabled. Let's keep going.	
103020301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Some sort of barrier is blocking access to the courtyard...	
103020302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	There's a high Punishing Virus response... behind the force field.	
103020303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It must be some kind of lair.	
103020304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Estate Butler	1	It is intended to protect you... This is your last chance...	
103020305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Estate Butler	1	Once you pass through this barrier, there's no turning back.	
103020306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Liv, insert your Levi-Gun core into the Terminal. It will short the force field.	
103020307	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	On it.	
103020308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Estate Butler	1	……	
103020309	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The force field has been overloaded. We can continue on our way!	
103020310	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Let's go.	
103020401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The fighting there is done. We don't have to rush. Let's clear out the Corrupted nearby first.	
103030101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Phew—mission accomplished.	
103030102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Very thorough. Thank you, Lucia.	
103030201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Those Constructs... look a bit abnormal...	
103030202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Their limbs and Inver-Devices are all destroyed, but they've still got vital signs.	
103030203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Stay...	
103030204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What happened to you? What are you trying to say?	
103030205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Stay... back...	
103030206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Someone installed Motion Bombs inside them!	
103030207	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	That's so... messed... up...	
103030208	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Disarming these bombs isn't possible right now... We can only give them a bit of distance...	
103030209	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	That's what happens when you oppose the Ascendants—I do not wish to see it happen anymore.	
103030210	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	But it's too late now. Don't say I didn't warn you.	
103030301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Loyal old Android. He has defended the Estate Museum for a very long time.	
103030302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	It would have ended quite differently if he had just succumbed to the power of Ascnet.	
103030303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	But, such is the fate of the weak.	
103030304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Go. Complete your final task.	
103030305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Thank you for releasing me...	
103030306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I... will not allow... them... to defile Mr. Copperfield's legacy...	
103030307	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Initiating... central nervous system... self-destruct sequence...	
103030308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Mr. Copperfield... In the end, I failed you. I couldn't protect the Estate...	
103030401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Lucia.	
103030402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What?	
103030403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Now show me what you can do.	
103030404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	……	
103030405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	I don't mind if the others join in, but in the end... only one of you will remain.	
103030406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	One of... us?	
103030407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Which one will it be?	
103030408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	You're weak... just like she said.	
103030409	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What... are you saying?	
103030410	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hey punk—	
103030411	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Over here!	
103030412	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	What?!	
104010101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	You found the monitors?	
104010102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Yeah... but any equipment exposed to the elements could have been infected.	
104010103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hope they still work. Let me try!	
104010104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	They seem to be working. It must be my lucky day.	
104010105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	We should bring them in for analysis.	
104010201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We need to find somewhere quiet. The battlefield isn't the place for computational work.	
104010202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	The tremors feel different here. I've got a bad feeling about this.	
104010301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I'll place some EMP bombs in strategic positions.	
104010302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Cover me, Lee. Don't hold back.	
104010303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	You got me...	
104010304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Take cover! Baby's gonna blow!	
104010305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Those things don't affect us... What were you thinking?	
104010401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The place is strewn with Corrupted parts...	
104010402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Status?	
104010403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's at 20% power. If we're doing something, now would be the time...	
104010404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Emma...	
104020101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's very hot here. Commandant... are you okay?	
104020102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	In and out. Find a supply point for Commandant.	
104020201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Target sighted! Wow... it looks a lot bigger in real life. What's it called again?	
104020202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Vassago, a kind of bionic Sand Worm. It moves through the sand and ambushes its prey.	
104020203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Remain vigilant. We don't have much experience in this kind of environment.	
104020301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Did you feel that, Lee?	
104020302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Yes. EM Camo. The enemy's using military-grade tech.

104020304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Identifying target code... BPO-29, status... Deserter?	
104020305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	???	1	Lucia? It's you...	
104020306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	???	1	Looks like... you aren't with the cleaners.	
104020401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Kamui, don't rush in!	
104020402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Worry not! This is the part I'm actually good at!	
104020403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I don't like that... I'm getting used to his style somehow...	
104020404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Status update?	
104020405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	...And they didn't even clear out the Corrupted here before telling us to set up a supply point?	
104020406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Whatever. More fun for me!	
104030101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	This place will be easy to defend.	
104030102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Why do we have to do all the fighting? Are they afraid or something?	
104030103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We've got no choice. They're in charge of transport.	
104030201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I can't believe he laid so many traps.	
104030202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	I just don't have that many folks I can spare, that's all.	
104030203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I'll get you!	
104030301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Kamui is fighting his own battle. Lee, I need you to take care of fire support. Hurry!	
104030302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Forget about those Corrupted! We've got to get Liv back!	
104030401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Wo-ah! There it is! The Vassa-thingamajig... I can never remember what it's called...	
104030402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Is it following us? What does it want?	
104030403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	We don't have time to play with you! Lie down like a good boy! HAIYA!!!	
104030404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Weird. It looked like it was going for Commandant...	
104040101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant... I...	
104040102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	No. I'm sure it'll be fine.	
104040103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Keep your eye on Lucia, Commandant.

104040201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	If you don't believe me, go look at those tombstones.

104040301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Surrender! I'm not going to kill any Constructs.	
104040302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I refuse!	
104040401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Watanabe can take care of Liv for us.	
104040402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Maybe we should put some distance between us and the enemy, Commandant.	
104040403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	……	
104040404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I'll stop 'em. You get Lee out of here, Commandant!	
105010101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We need to move fast. I just hope Kamui's map is accurate...	
105010102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Don't make too much noise. We don't want to alert the Forsaken. They're still holding Liv...	
105010201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	This facility is probably rigged. Stay sharp...	
105010202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lee? Kamui?!	
105010203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What is it?	
105010204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Gone...?	
105010205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Visual system errors? Disorder in the M.I.N.D.?	
105010206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The Corrupted signals have recovered. We'll have to fight... It won't hurt them, will it?	
105010301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The next batch of projectors is in position.	
105010302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Follow my mark.	
105010401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Graviton detector imaging has commenced. The image is fuzzy, but will suffice.	
105010402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	But these Corrupted aren't projections.	
105010403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	How did the Forsaken get through here with no Graviton Detectors?	
105010404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I guess they know this place... Why else would they bring Liv here straight?	
105020101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	If we want the EMP to affect the maximum number of projectors, we need to find the best spot.	
105020102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	There's Corrupted everywhere. I'll send a signal when the coast is clear.

105020104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	NOW!!!	
105020105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Okay.	
105020201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	You said to not let Kamui out of our sights. Is there something?	
105020202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Well, seeing how we're on the dedicated Gray Raven channel...	
105020203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I was just checking Kamui's Inver-Device...	
105020204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It was running on high-load mode. And there are logs of him trying to turn off his GPS and Comms systems.	
105020205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Turning off his own...	
105020206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	He might have his own plans... but I think we definitely need to check in with him more.	
105020301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Corrupted are shielding the projectors...	
105020302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The one in the middle seems different. I think it must hold the secret to this place.	
105020303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Okay, here goes!	
105020401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commencing capture of next target.	
105020402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Kamui, don't damage its memory shell.	
105020403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Haha, as long as I don't hit him directly, he'll be fine...	
105020404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Done—over to you, Lee.	
105030101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Show Nanami the M.I.N.D. or you'll regret it—

105030103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Such strength! Not even a scratch?!	
105030104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Pffft! This is boring!	
105030105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Nanami's had enough.	
105030201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	This place looks quite oriental. It takes me back...	
105030202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	……	
105030301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We're in Liv's M.I.N.D. She's already showing signs of the Punishing Virus.	
105030302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Tch. That Watanabe... He best get ready for a beating after this...	
105030303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv!	
105030401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Don't hold back, Lucia! We might not get another chance!	
105030402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	(Deep breaths) Very well...	
105030403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv...	
106010101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	We're on top of Underground Refugee City 019. During the Post-Pandemic Age it was home to half a million refugees.	
106010102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	That's about one-third of Babylonia's current population. Of course, it all ended in tragedy.	
106010103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Corpses are piled high at the exits... indicating the severity of the final crisis that erupted inside...	
106010104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Our objective is the Ascendants. Let the archeologists take care of history.	
106010105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Wait. Something's climbing up under the elevator!	
106010106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Finally, some movement.	
106010107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	The door's open.	
106010201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We need to cross the walkway to keep moving down.	
106010202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Hurry. We don't want to get caught out on a bridge.	
106010203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Haha! Lucia knows her away around a battlefield!	
106010204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Everyone, I've picked up... a familiar signal.	
106010205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Executing purification mission, target: Forsaken...	
106010301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	That Corrupted used to be... a giant omni-directional mobility firefighting device...	
106010302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	So what you're saying is... it knows hydro-pump!	
106010401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hey. Why have we got fewer Corrupted than the Forsaken? You been slacking off or something?	
106010402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It's not a competition...	
106010403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Snap out of it, Nanami. You helping or not?	
106010404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	I'm waiting!	
106010405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	For what?	
106010406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	The one behind you!	
106020101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We can deal with Kamui later. Our top priority is clearing the path ahead.	
106020102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant, hold your position at the center of the group until we pass.

106020202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Then he's bound to come to "her" attention...	
106020203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	I know full well how that's like.

106020206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	When there's still so many Corrupted... covert action is the only option.

106020401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	I'll start laying out the detonators.

131301214	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	If we activate the radar near there, the Corrupted will be gathering even faster, which will leave us no time to retreat.

94000702	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SailikaNomal01.png	Celica	1	The good news is, someone sponsored us a bunch of Cogs. We were running out.	
94000703	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SailikaNomal01.png	Celica	1	The bad news is, we aren't the only ones after them.	
94000704	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SailikaNomal01.png	Celica	1	We have to get our hands on these resources asap.	
94000401	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SailikaNomal01.png	Celica	1	The new materials arrived today, but the transport team got sloppy and lost some along the way.	
94000402	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SailikaNomal01.png	Celica	1	Could you go and salvage the missing materials for us?	
94000403	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SailikaNomal01.png	Celica	1	Keep in mind, this area is not secure. Do your best to avoid all enemy contact.	
94000404	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SailikaNomal01.png	Celica	1	Collect 5 crates and then extract. No need to take unnecessary risks! Good luck.

302010101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Gold dust falling from the sky... I was right. Some device is sending gold dust to high altitudes.	
302010102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Metallic dust is sometimes used to cause electrical interference. Those mechanoids seem unaffected by it though.	
302010103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	They must be the "Mechanoid Guards" Browning described.	
302010104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Avoid or attack. I'm good with either. You decide, Commandant.	
302010105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	These guards aren't easy to deal with. I sure hope Liv is okay...	
302010201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I dug them up and compared their chassis numbers. They're Goldfinch units.	
302010202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Where I found them, there were three immobilized guards. One of them could be the "culprit".	
302010203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We must find the "culprit" and get to the bottom of it.	
302010204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Maybe their remains will hold some clues.	
302010205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Whatever made these markings... has got to be the same type of Construct...	
302010206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lee, turn him over... What's that on his back?	
302010207	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	...Yep. It's a Goldfinch Inducer.	
302010301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Browning	1	It's well guarded for some place that's in the middle of nowhere...	
302010302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Browning	1	Frontal assault is not our thing... Give them the slip, then pick off the weak.	
302010401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Browning	1	An underground facility...	
302010402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Goldfinch Member	1	Browning! Multiple contacts!	
302010403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Browning	1	We aren't equipped for this.	
302010404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Browning	1	Pull back to the bridge!	
302010405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Goldfinch Member	1	Unknown force field detected. If we continue towards the bridge, we'll get shredded...	
302010406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Browning	1	Cover me while I set up a terminal to lift the field!	
302010407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Browning	1	There's one more, waiting in ambush... OPEN FIRE!!!	
302010501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant, this one's different. Normally I'd suggest pulling back...	
302010502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	But we've got to stop it emitting that distress signal.	
302010503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	They just keep coming! There's no time! Take it down, Commandant!	
302010601	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lee still hasn't found Liv... Sorry. I shouldn't have been distracted...	
302010602	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The Construct models outside are no longer used in Babylonia.	
302010603	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I've been observing closely. There's no guards beyond the hideout. Please stay here, Commandant...	
302010604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I'm going to copy their combat logs. Maybe we can get some intel...	
302010605	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Unknown Construct	1	Gold... Gold...	
302010606	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Unknown Construct	1	The Queen gives us... hope.	
302010607	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The Queen...?	
302010701	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	So the Mechanoid Guards were using these secret tunnels for rapid deployment.	
302010702	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The tunnels are covered in tin, blocking electrical signals of any forces moving through them.	
302010703	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Iron Maiden	1	Construct... are you a royal guard, or slave?	
302010704	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	You sneak along behind me and never show yourself. I almost thought you were being shy.	
302010705	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Iron Maiden	1	I've decided. You must be a slave.	
302010706	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Iron Maiden	1	The Queen... needs me...	
302010707	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	She has the ability to overpower me... so why is she running?	
302010801	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Fighting on constricted terrain eliminates the enemy's numerical advantage.	
302010802	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	But it doesn't leave much space for evasion.	
302010803	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant, Lee and I aren't in very good shape. For this battle, you'll need to access Construct operating systems.	
302010804	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lower performance could cause Dodge lag and other problems. I'd feel better if you had access.	
302010805	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	If you don't mind, Commandant...	
302010806	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Iron Maiden	1	My dream... is over...	
302010901	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Browning	1	I've got to reduce Construct energy consumption... to save energy...	
302010902	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Please stay by me when I fight.	
302010903	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let me take care of the fighting. I'll keep you safe.	
302011001	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's unbelievable how many guards are lurking under the sand!	
302011002	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Browning, you're in charge of the Excavator. I'll stop the guards.	
302011003	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Guards have been pushed back. Browning, is everything okay?	
302011004	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Browning	1	Don't come over here!	
302011101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Huh? The combat system has security measures...?	
302011102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Why didn't Browning mention it...?	
302011103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Stay calm, Liv... I need to beat them to change the energy protocols.	
302011104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	...How?!! There are no energy protocols! It's a dummy system!	
302020101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	So many guards... If you can't fix the defense systems, get over here! I'm in trouble!	
302020102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	I'll just grab one to examine.	
302020103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	So the siren has three alarms.	
302020104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	The first two alert the guards. The third one goes to a proxy terminal.	
302020105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	This thing is basically useless now.	
302020201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Why are they all kneeling here?	
302020202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	... Besides the battle damage, they're in pretty good shape.	
302020203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	More guards... They just never end.	
302020204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Goldfinch, can your people still fight?	
302020301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	If I win, you have to come clean with me.	
302020302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Not gonna happen, because I'm not losing.	
302020303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	So many guards...	
302020304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Let bygones be bygones. I won't follow you anymore. We should go our separate ways.	
302020401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	If I'm not mistaken, these engines drive those artificial sandstorms around the Golden Vortex.	
302020402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	But it stands to reason there must be more engines to generate so many sand storms.	
302020403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	My people... probably aren't trapped here.	
302020404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	I've been spotted! Better deal with these guys first...	
302020405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Did someone rob a bank? This place is crawling with guards.	
302020406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Better rush over, just in case.	
302020501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	I'm standing right in front of them and still nothing? Maybe these Mechanoids aren't guards after all.	
302020502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Looks like they've got some kind of golden ring marked on them... Hard to tell what it is.	
302020503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	What's that sound...? It's been ringing for ages...	
302020504	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Da-da-di-da, di-di-da, di, di, da-di. What could it mean?	
302020601	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	I'm not gonna fight you, at least not now.	
302020602	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	This place is crawling with guards. And I only just found my people.	
302020603	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	...Where is he?	
302020604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	If I can flush him out, have his men draw the guards' attention, he's bound to make an appearance.	
302020605	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Unconscious Forsaken	1	Ah! Run! Shhh! The Warden's coming!	
302020606	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Got to make sure those guards don't hurt him.	
302020607	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Unconscious Forsaken	1	Run! Run! He's coming! Run!	
302020608	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Unconscious Forsaken	1	I'm so scared... Leader, save me...

302020701	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Roland's probably cowering inside. There's no gold dust floating around in here.	
302020702	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Fancy being brought to your knees by a spec of gold dust.

302020704	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Whatever. I know you're gonna call in reinforcements.	
302020705	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	It doesn't matter who you send, the gold dust has turned you all into jelly!

302020806	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	So... you must be the "Warden". If not for the Forsaken, you might have tricked me.	
302020807	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Hostage	1	You dare oppose the will of the Queen!?

302020906	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	There's a few more left... Let me repay that volley with interest!

302030204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Enough! There is still some distance away from the main building. Come with me!	
302030205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Alright... And you're not even praising Nanami...	
302030301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Ding-Ding-Dong... Ding-Ding-Dong... What are you installing, Karenina?	
302030302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	There are so many guards. Don't tell me you're still gonna barge in by yourself.	
302030303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	It's time for me to do some improvisation.	
302030304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Introducing my "automatic cannon" device. With it and my firepower, the guards pose no threat to us.	
302030401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	So many Corrupted! So exciting! Nanami loves it!	
302030402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Core parts for hacking can definitely be found from these waves of Corrupted.	
302030403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Nanami is going to find it!	
302030404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Congratulations, Nanami... Core parts get!	
302030405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Hm...? A reinforcement request?	
302030406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	All Corrupted... Come to my coordinates... Eliminate all your obstacles...	
302030407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Whoa! Amazing!	
302030408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Your reinforcements will be right there, Roland!	
302030501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	One transceiver terminal is not enough to avoid disruptions while rebuilding the channel.	
302030502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	The guards are definitely gonna notice once the terminal is on... It's so damn heavy too...	
302030503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Where even is Nanami!	
302030504	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Channel 1 restored in one go... Luck is on my side.	
302030505	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Internet channel restored... for perhaps a few minutes...	
302030506	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Whatever! I need to quickly upload the antibody's analysis report.	
302030601	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	1, 2, 3... and the one blocked by you, there are 4 air outlets in total.	
302030602	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	We can only do two of them... These guards are required for the remaining...	
302030603	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Quick! Nanami! Stuff the guards in!	
302030604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Must have them all collapse... on the air outlets...	
302030605	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Then their mobility will be limited... after Nithart reconnects to them.	
302030606	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Ah, Nanami has seen some of the defeated guards came alive. So they were "reconnected"!	
302030607	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	That's right... Seems like only a few of them can be reconnected.	
302030608	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	The influence of the antibodies weakened...	
302030609	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Nanami... Thank you! I owe you one.	
302030610	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Naughty Roland! Hmph!	
302030611	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	...Partially utilizing the Punishing Virus is impracticable, huh. As expected.	
302030612	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Naughty Roland, Nanami's gonna bring you home!	
302030701	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	A Construct kneeling before a guard... Is that supposed to be an insult towards us?	
302030702	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Wait! The guard's cognition device contains the blueprint of the Golden Vortex.	
302030703	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	They were the initial builders of this spectacle in the desert.	
302030704	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	...Can we just extract the blueprint directly? In this case, we'll know the exact route!	
302030705	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	We can't... There's an extract permission, and we only... have two chances...	
302030706	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Also, some of the blueprints are fake...	
302030707	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	What if... we extract the fake one?	
302030708	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	………………	
302030709	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Bingo! Incredible me!	
302030710	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	We were just lucky, you dimwit...	
302030801	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	That wimp has absorbed the gold dust, and that's why it became that strong...	
302030802	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	It's gonna be a tough battle...	
302030803	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Not like it's going to stop me! Let's duke it out!	
302030804	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	If we defeat them all and collect some gold dust, we may be able to cut it down to size.	
302030805	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Still, I need to build an equipment to spread the gold dust into the air...

302030903	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Be prepared for doom, Golden Vortex.	
302030904	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Still gonna resist...?	
302030905	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Master-Control Program	1	Power system crashed... Eliminating... eliminating errors...	
302031001	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Have they noticed Nanami?	
302031002	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Obviously! Cut the crap and come with me to protect Nanami!	
302031003	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Hurry up! Connect the guard's system for me!	
302031004	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Nanami is isolated and helpless, I have to get in and help her!	
302031101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Just put on the bio-booster arms found by Nanami! I can feel the tremendous power inside them!	
302031102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I should try them on the Queen's guards later!	
302031103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	But first, I need to test the arms' strength...	
302031104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	The only place defended by the Queen's royal guards within the whole Golden Vortex is the Queen's bedchamber.	
302031105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I hope their strength is worthy of their title!	
302031106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	The Queen's Royal Guard	1	How dare you trespass on the Queen's prohibited zone... Pay with your lives!	
302031107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Yeah! Nanami is going to meet Commandant real soon!	
302031108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	But what about the front door?	
302031109	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Don't worry. I can pry it open with one hand!	
302040101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NiteNomal.png	Nithart	1	Don't let go of any of them! Destroy them all!	
302040102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NiteNomal.png	Nithart	1	Commandant! This is your last chance!	
302040103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NiteNomal.png	Nithart	1	If you abandon those Constructs now, I can spare your life!	
302040201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	There's a traitor among Nithart's guards... Nanami has met it before. It owns the door key...	
302040202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Traitor? Nanami, you...?	
302040203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Nanami has once connected to Nithart's network for a short time. If she says there's a key, there must be one.	
302040204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	It used to be a Construct. The hole in its security system allowed it to shortly get rid of Nithart's control...	
302040205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Scatter! Find the Construct guard! Find the traitor!	
302040206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I've just hacked into it, but I couldn't find any keys...	
302040207	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Don't give up! Bianca also found a Construct guard, let's go there now!	
302040208	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Successfully hacked... but still there's no key in it...	
302040209	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NiteNomal.png	Nithart	1	Don't ever think about hiding that from me!	
302040210	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NiteNomal.png	Nithart	1	Guards! Quick! Obliterate the traitor with the key!	
302040220	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Guard	1	Thank you for releasing me from Nithart's control...	3
302040301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Too many guards here. No point wasting my energy with them...	
302040302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	We can operate them to battle after transferring their control to my virtual control console...	
302040303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	But I can only build one virtual control console with the materials I have...	
302040304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	One virtual control console can only hijack one guard's control...	
302040305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Which one should we choose?	
302040401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant, I see Nanami on the platform far from our right side...	
302040402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	She must have dropped into the wrong tunnel and eventually fell there.	
302040403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	She's not the type to keep quiet.	
302040404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Watch out, Nithart's guards are coming at us through the other entrance.	
302040405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	She won't let go of us easily. So get ready to fight!	
302040406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant, Nanami is fighting alone, please closely monitor her frame's condition...	
302040501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NiteNomal.png	Nithart	1	Look what I've got you...	
302040502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NiteNomal.png	Nithart	1	Exhibit again that conceit you've shown me before, or my guards will turn you into scrap.	
302040503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	...Most cunning. Thankfully, I'm her opponent.	
302040504	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	I have to return to Commandant as quickly as possible.	
302040505	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	It's the last...	
302040506	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NiteNomal.png	Nithart	1	Destroy her! This is an order from the Queen! Destroy her!	
302040601	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	The virus has damaged the security process of the energy system. Our hacking is going well so far!	
302040602	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Implant the "anti-virus programs"...	
302040603	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	If we're able to send these anti-virus programs to the corrupted zone, the infection speed will be greatly slowed down...	
302040604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I've already defeated two Corrupted outside...	
302040605	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Keep pushing! Don't lose to "yourself," Kamui!	
302040606	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	The corrupted zone is ahead...	
302040607	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	This should buy some time for the Gray Raven, right?	
302040701	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Unable to open?! What does that mean! I managed to crack into it...	
302040702	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	That's because your crack is one-way only. You can only open all security doors if you execute the crack.	
302040703	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	But in that case, the guards can also get in and surround us.	
302040704	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	So, apart from an "open door" function, we need a "close door" one as well. The two actions must be done at the same time.	
302040705	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Easy-peasy! I can connect the two cracking devices to the same "repeater". Problem solved.	
302040706	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Well, repeating is the easy part. The difficult part is that the second cracking device has to connect the "closing" system.	
302040707	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	As door opening and door closing are two separate systems, we can only crack it one by one.	
302040708	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Lucia and the others are defending against the guards outside. We have to crack the door closing system quickly.	
302040709	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	You need to be quick. As more and more guards are trying to break through the exterior wall, they will break through our defense soon...	
302040710	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Right... But why did the crack fail? Definitely nothing to do with my devices.	
302040711	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Yes, Nithart crashed the system on purpose while we were cracking. That's why it failed.	
302040712	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I'll connect the door closing system to my virtual console. If she does that again, she'll be redirected to it.	
302040713	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Operating the final crack... Security doors opened...	
302040714	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...Everyone, through the security door! Quick!	
302040715	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lee...	
302040716	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Okay. Operating the final crack... Security doors closed...	
302040801	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Watch your front and back, the guards are tightening the encirclement...	
302040802	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We have to destroy them all to prevent them from attacking the rescue aircraft.	
302040803	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	The royal guards are very difficult to handle. If we don't want to be attacked from both sides, we'd better concentrate our firepower on one side first.	
302040804	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Commandant, quick! Which side! I'm gonna blow them all to smithereens!	
302040901	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Nithart... she turned off the external sensorium of her frame.	
302040902	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	She and the royal guards have already fused into one. Even if we concentrate our firepower on her, we'll still be unable to interrupt the guards' attack.	
302040903	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Just blow 'em all up!	
302040904	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Can we attack now? Nanami wants to fight!	
302040905	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	The Golden Vortex will turn into an inferno soon. We'd better go now. We can't let Nithart be on our way...	
302040906	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant, let's make a clean break with Nithart.

303152108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	Wait for it to move near the white line on the left.	
303152109	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	And tap the button on the left to clear it.	
303152110	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	Light beams will come out both from the left and the right.	
303152111	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	The light beam on the right is <color=#00CCFF>Blue</color>. When it moves near the white line on the right,	
303152112	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	tap the button on the right to clear it.	
303152113	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	Now let's give it a go.	
303152114	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	When the light beams on both sides are identical, they will be in <color=#FFCC00>yellow</color>.	
303152115	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	And you need to tap both buttons at the same time to clear them.	
303152116	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	Give it a try.	
303152117	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	And then, a new note will show up.	
303152118	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	It is comprised of two light beams front and back and an arrow in between.	
303152119	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	You need to tap the button when the first light beam reaches the white line and keep pressing it	
303152120	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	until the second light beam reaches the white line.	
303152121	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	During one [Pressing and holding] action, points and massive Combo will be generated both when you press and release.

303152202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	I'll start the calibration program guide. Please make adjustments according to the instructions.	
303152203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	Tap the [+] and the [-] buttons to adjust the effective position of hitting the notes.	
303152204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	When the [Deviation] is 0, the hit position will overlap the white line.	
303152205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	The lower the [Deviation], the more the position will be moved forward.	
303152206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	After the adjustments are done, tap the [Save] button to save and exit the calibration program.	
303152207	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	Moving the effective position to where suitable will help you score higher.

313020402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Perhaps it can be used to recognize our true identities.	
313020403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Will recognizing who we are... really help us get through this situation?	
313020404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Commandant, it seems you have to change your connection target.	
313020405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Will the next guy find Commandant?	
313020406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Not sure, but we've already narrowed down the range of searching area. We should be able to calculate Commandant's location very soon.	
313020407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	I'll see you at that place, Commandant.	
313020501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	Liv	1	Consciousness connection...	
313020502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	Liv	1	In a nutshell, Commandant exists within my body in addition to ■■■■■, right?	
313020503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	Liv	1	Let us show you the power of the trio, Corrupted!	
313020504	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	Liv	1	Ah, It's the message from ■■■■■. I'll go to the rendezvous point too.	
313020505	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	Liv	1	Commandant, wait for me!	
313020801	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	I'll repeat the rules, just for you.	
313020802	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Those standing before you are the Constructs closest to you.	
313020803	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	The reason they become like this is because of your cognitive bias.	
313020804	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Next, I'll ask questions like which one is the real Liv and which one is the real Kamui.	
313020805	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	What you need to do is to point out their true identities.	
313020806	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Of course, it'd be great if you're right. But if you're wrong—	
313020807	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Nozzle comes close to initiating a self-destruct sequence. This will damage you and the Constructs.	
313020808	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Humph, are you really be able to recognize each of them? I look forward to your performance.	
313020811	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	What? This is...!	
313020851	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Wrong. That's a pity. Your Constructs will get hurt if you don't pay more attention.	
313020852	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	First Question. Which one is Kamui?	
313020853	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Correct, though it's merely a simple one.	
313020854	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Second question. Which one is Liv?	
313020855	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Correct. As expected, that humility has made it too obvious.	
313020856	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Third question. Which one is Bianca?	
313020857	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	How does it feel like to be mistaken for Watanabe, your sworn enemy?	
313020858	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	—!	
313020859	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	No need to overreact. I've been watching it from the very beginning.	
313020860	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Fourth question. Which one is Ayla?	
313020861	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	No fun. When she said association, the answer nearly came to the surface.	
313020862	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Fifth question. Which one is Chrome?	
313020863	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	That said, Chrome appearing in this place really surprised me. I thought he was preparing for the next special mission.	
313020864	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Sixth Question. Which one is Lee?	
313020865	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Well, as you've excluded all deceptive answers, it's no surprise that you chose the correct one.	
313020866	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Why don't you give scythes a shot? You seem to be a great scythe wielder.	
313020867	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	After all, nothing is hard for you... Hah.	
313020868	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Seventh question. Which one is Karenina... To be honest, I don't want to go on like this either. The rest are all super simple ones.	
313020869	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Uh... Alright alright. Correct. All words coming from this mouth would be censored by the connection system.	
313020870	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	The last question. Which one is Lucia? Press the confirm button <color=#ff6633>now</color> to finish this game.	
313020871	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Why don't you act? Lucia stood right there. You didn't fall asleep, did you?	
313020872	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	...What!?	
313020873	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	That's not Lucia... Hahahaha, so you really can recognize her. Hahaha!	
313020874	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Perfect. You're right...	
313020875	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	—!!	
313020876	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	...For hell's sake. I knew it. The bond between commandant and Construct is but a joke.	
313020877	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	How can you not recognize the Construct staying by your side all the time?	
313020878	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	No way. How can you pick this one? You're not a moron, aren't you?	
313020879	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Fine...	
313020880	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Lu... Musashi, catch that Nozzle!	
313020881	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	???	1	Here, Commandant!	
313030101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Hey, Akdilek girl, what are you doing...?	
313030102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Sorry, my hand slipped.	
313030103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Causing troubles instead of killing me, huh... Lucky that you're a Support type.	
313030104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Sophia doesn't understand what you are talking about.	
313030105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Whatever... Keep pretending.	
313030106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	But you can't keep hiding. We have big guys coming.	
313030107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	As expected, they are Attacker Constructs. Very old models though.	
313030108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	What exactly are you planning?	
313030301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Can I use these leaves?	
313030302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Yeah, they still have a bitter taste, but I guess we don't have a better option.	
313030303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	We need more though. These aren't enough.	
313030304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Corrupted spotted. Let's get rid of them first.	
313030351	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I never knew there were plants in the desert.	3
313030352	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	Liv	1	I feel sorry for these plants...	3
313030353	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	I bet these leaves have never thought they would get picked in a desert.	3
313030354	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I wonder what kind of zongzi Lucia would like?	3
313030355	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	Liv	1	Commandant, I think red bean will be a great addition to the zongzi.	3
313030356	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	The leaves are a bit annoying, but zongzi contain meat and rice, making them a great food.	3
313030501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	This Corrupted... I knew it...	
313030502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Focus on the Corrupted around you. You could easily die if you get distracted.	
313030503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	Yes! Got it.	
313040301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System Voice	1	Truth or dare!	
313040302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System Voice	1	Answer the other person's question within the time limit!	
313040303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System Voice	1	If you can't answer, or refuse to... You'll have to perform a daring forfeit!	
313040304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	So this is like a mind training, where Liv must answer Commandant's questions. I will do my best!	
313040305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System Voice	1	Question: What's your fondest wish?	
313040306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	To defeat Punishing Virus and take back the Earth.	
313040307	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System Voice	1	Question: What will you do if your most important person argues with you?	
313040308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	Could it be... I have done something wrong? I'll try to correct my mistake, and apologize to Com—to that person, I mean.	
313040309	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System Voice	1	Question: Which type of boyfriend do you prefer: cat or dog?	
313040310	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	Huh...? What do you mean by cat and dog...?	
313040311	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	An animal as boyfriend...?	
313040312	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	Lee	1	No way.	
313040313	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System Voice	1	Too bad! You failed to answer within the time limit! You must face a forfeit!	
313040314	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	The ammo of my Levi-Gun has all become water... Is it because we are in a game?	
313040315	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	Lee	1	It's a game from the Golden Age. The questions are probably based on the pop culture of that era.	
313040316	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	I see. I need a better understanding of the Golden Age culture to answer these questions.	
313040317	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	Let me connect to the old human database... Alright. Liv will be able to answer any question now!	
313040318	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	???	1	Here comes the first question—	
313040319	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	???	1	<color=#ff0000>What is the most horrible thing you have ever done to Commandant?</color>	
313040320	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	What?! How can there be such a question? How did it know...	
313040321	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	???	1	Countdown: 3—2—	
313040322	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	Argh... I-I once took away the snacks that Commandant hid in the room!	
313040323	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	???	1	The second question is—	
313040324	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	???	1	<color=#ff0000>Tell us one thing that you regret the most.</color>	
313040325	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	...There are many of them. I can't really tell them all...	
313040326	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	???	1	Hmm... Let's skip this question then.	
313040327	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	???	1	Last question: <color=#ff0000>Tell us one thing that you absolutely don't want Commandant to know!</color>	
313040328	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	Absolutely...not...	
313040329	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Liv, are you alright? Your face looks really red.	
313040330	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	I... I choose the dare!	
313040401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Here—comes—Nanami!	
313040402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	Lee	1	You just put your personal data in here... That was so risky.	
313040403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	Lee	1	I trust you have heard us. They are very important, so you must not break them.	
313040404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Nanami found them! Don't stop Nanami!	
313040451	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown01.png	Watermelon	1	The watermelon has a metallic shine. This must be the "mission item" that Liv mentioned.	3
313040452	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown01.png	Surfboard	1	There's a line printed on it: "A rare item that was used by humans to tame the tide in early days."	3

313040454	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown01.png	Starry Floatie	1	Good-looking, but not too practical. Maybe a bit rough.	3
313040455	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown01.png	Sand Castle	1	Once a majestic project, but now it's in ruins.	3
313040501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	Those monsters...aren't targeting us.	
313040502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	Lee	1	They are moving toward the mission items!	
313040503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Why would they want to destroy game items?	
313040504	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Nanami only put us in the game. I didn't control their actions.	
313040505	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	Lee	1	Perhaps there's something in the watermelon. Let's stop them first.

313070201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Suddenly turned into an indoor scene...?	
313070202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Wait, Commandant! I can't find Lee and Lucia.	
313070203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	East General	1	Relax. I invited them to the room to help set up the test.	
313070204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Test?	
313070205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	East General	1	Yes. In this room you will see two of your comrades next to their illusions.	
313070206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	East General	1	Talk to them, find out which ones are real, and rescue them. That's your test.

313070214	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Sure thing.	
313070215	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	No, Commandant, this one is not Lucia.	
313070216	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	East General	1	Can't believe you got it wrong. A penalty is in order.

313070220	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	The general decides what intel I can or cannot give you...	
313070221	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Anyway, I am Lee. I can fire consecutive shots when Red Orb is activated.

313070225	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Phew... So we passed the test, right, General?	
313070226	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	East General	1	Yes.	
313070227	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	No, Commandant, this one is not Lee.	
313070228	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	East General	1	Can't believe you got it wrong. A penalty is in order.

313070230	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	East General	1	Good. Liv found her real comrades and passed the test in the end.	
313070231	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	East General	1	Congratulations! Here's your reward—the key to the ghost-hunting venue.

313070234	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Kuroro	1	Perhaps I can help.

313070236	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Kuroro	1	You did it! When you see the real one, you will understand!	
313070237	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Didn't know the test would involve me being tied up...

313070302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Counting skills...?	
313070303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	South General	1	Mm-hmm. The machines will be erratically moving around within a confined area. You need to remember how many of them there are and what they look like.	
313070304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	South General	1	Say, we have three Repairers, a Ground Monitor, and an Aerial Monitor within the confined area.	
313070305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	South General	1	I'll ask you: "Which one is the most numerous?"	
313070306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	I see.	
313070307	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	South General	1	Alrighty. If there are no more questions, let's get started!	
313070308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	South General	1	Correct... Congratulations, you passed the test. Here's the key!	
313070309	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Is that a portrait of Bianca?	
313070310	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Kuroro	1	Not satisfied, huh?	
313070311	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Kuroro	1	Perhaps I can help.	
313070312	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Kuroro	1	Ku—ro—ro!	
313070313	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Kuroro	1	You did it! When you make a choice, you will understand!	
313070401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	West General	1	I've been waiting for you, Challengers! I am West General. I will be testing your courage in the face of evil!	
313070402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Courage...?	
313070403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	West General	1	Yep. Ahead of you is an abyss littered with traps.	
313070404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	West General	1	You just need to do one thing: observe and find a way out!	
313070405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	West General	1	Just so we're clear... I'm not like those two you met earlier. My traps are no child's play. Hehe.	
313070406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	What...?	
313070407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Just avoid the traps, and we'll be fine. I trust Commandant's judgment and will follow accordingly.	
313070408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Let's begin, Commandant.	
313070409	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	West General	1	What... the hell?!	
313070410	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	So the key this time... Uh, isn't this Liv?	
313070411	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Didn't expect to see a Gray Raven on it.	
313070412	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Kuroro	1	Not satisfied, huh?	
313070413	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Kuroro	1	Perhaps I can help.	
313070414	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Kuroro	1	Ku—ro—ro!	
313070415	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Kuroro	1	You did it! I shall illuminate your path forward!	
313070501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Commandant... Something's wrong. My body is...	
313070502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	North General	1	That's because I rigged this place. Anyway, just remember: only one "tactic" per person.	
313070503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	In other words, Commandant, each one of us can only use one type of Signal Orbs.	
313070504	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	North General	1	Allocate your powers properly to beat the challenge. Consider this a test of your leadership, Commandant.	
313070505	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	North General	1	Uh... How could you still win after I set so many restrictions?!	
313070506	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	If it was just you versus me, you might yet stand a chance. But I'm not fighting alone.	
313070507	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I'm with the Gray Raven squad.	
313070508	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	North General	1	Ughhh!	
313070509	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	And so the fourth key bears the portrait of... Nanami.	
313070510	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Kuroro	1	Long time no see! I take it you still remember me from the previous tests?	
313070511	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Kuroro	1	Well, I will continue to assist you in this one.	
313070512	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Kuroro	1	Ku—ro—ro!	
313070513	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Kuroro	1	You did it! May you have infinite energy and Skill Orbs!	
313090301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Tsk, guess I just have to start repairing the comms device.	
313090302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	What can I do to help you?	
313090303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Help me take care of those newbies.	
313090304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	That would be better for them.	
313090305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	...Alright.	
313090306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	I need two parts to repair it. A portable battery and a receiver.	
313090307	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	These Terrapods were supposed to be practice partners for new soldiers...	
313090308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Right, I can find suitable batteries on them.	
313090309	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Guess this model will work...	
313090310	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	What was that sound?	
313090311	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	No, it's from the warehouse. I've got to check it out.	
313090312	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Hmm? This place is supposed to be unmanned. What are you doing here?

313090314	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Sentry duty... Why weren't you here just now?	
313090315	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	...I'm sorry, but you can't go through here.

313090319	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	No, I'm sorry.	
313090321	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Instructor... I said, you must not go through.

313090326	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Ugh! How did you break the barrier, Instructor...?	
313090331	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Ugh... You are too powerful, Instructor.	
313090332	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Hmph, let me see what you're trying to hide.	
313090336	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	I knew the receiver was in here. Dammit! Why is the barrier starting on its own?!	
313090337	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Lucky there was backup ID card from the training center.

313090373	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	You activated the Terrapods, didn't you?	
313090374	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	The bottom layer codes of the Terrapod were tampered with. I bet you are going to cheat for the test a few days later!	
313090375	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	S-sorry, Instructor Karenina! I don't want to fail...	
313090376	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Hoh? How about I give you a zero right away and send you back where you came from?

313094003	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Just like Mistress Jamilah said.	
313094004	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PulaoNormal01.png	Pulao	1	And whose fault is that?!	
313094005	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Anyway, we still need some preparation before leaving the message. You can go to the comms room and wait for us.	
313094006	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PulaoNormal01.png	Pulao	1	What are you doing?	
313094007	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	A special performance to make ourselves stand out, of course.	
313094008	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Speaking of the performance, what's your plan?	
313094009	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	I don't have a partner to perform kungfu with. Let's go with a safer option, lion dance!	
313094010	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	We'll need more performers for the lion dance then.

313094061	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Excuse me, would you like to join our lion dance team?	
313094062	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man B	1	Lion dance...? I said I was busy. I've got no time to play with you.	
313094063	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	We're not "playing." We are doing real lion dance.

313094074	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Good.	
313094081	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Excuse me, that merchant lost some goods. Have you seen it?	
313094082	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man B	1	W-what?! What do I have to do with that?	
313094083	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	I'm just asking around because he can't find them.

313094092	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man B	1	No. I'm busy!	
313094093	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Busy shipping the stolen goods out, huh?	
313094094	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Sophia?	
313094095	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man B	1	Aye... Wait, what are you talking about?	
313094096	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Enough said. I can smell a lie in you.

313094114	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Let me talk to him.	
313094121	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	You're working really hard. Must be very exhausting.	
313094122	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WulunNormal01.png	Ballwheel	1	You bet! Have to finish Foreman's assignment.	
313094123	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Anyway, I like your wheels. Did you just paint them?	
313094124	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WulunNormal01.png	Ballwheel	1	Haha, you've got great taste! I changed them on the deck a few days ago.	
313094125	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Oh? Have you been here all along these days?	
313094126	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WulunNormal01.png	Ballwheel	1	Yeah, I'm always here.	
313094127	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Good, there's something I need to ask you. Have you noticed any abnormal behavior from that Hanged Man over there?	
313094128	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	For example, moving something in secret?	
313094129	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WulunNormal01.png	Ballwheel	1	Hmm... Now you mention it, I saw him moving something last night.	
313094130	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	I see. Thank you very much!	
313094141	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man B	1	What are you doing here again? I said I didn't see anything...	
313094142	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Lying is not good, you know?	
313094143	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man B	1	I-I never lied!	
313094144	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Hmph! We already found a witness. He told me everything you did! Are you going to confess or not?	
313094145	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man B	1	I... I...	
313094146	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Shut up! Give the goods back!	
313094147	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man B	1	Dammit, took me so long to get them...	
313094148	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	But they aren't yours. Sophia hates those who disrupt the trade.	
313094149	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man B	1	Alright, alright... Take them!	
313094150	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Good on you. Never too late to change!	
313094151	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Now that we are done, do you want to join my lion dance team?	
313094152	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man B	1	I'm busy... Well, not anymore. Wouldn't hurt to join.

313094161	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	I've got all your goods back.	
313094162	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man A	1	Really? I thought you were joking. Where did you find them?	
313094163	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Another Hanged Man stole them.	
313094164	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man A	1	Another Hanged Man... Don't tell me it's that guy!	
313094165	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Let's put that aside for now. Are you going to join our team?	
313094166	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man A	1	You found me the good, and I will keep my promise.	
313094167	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Great, let's have a lot of fun together!

313094173	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man B	1	Take them and go! Don't come back!	
313094181	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	We got all your goods back.	
313094182	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man A	1	Really? I thought you were joking. Where did you find them?	
313094183	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Another Hanged Man stole them. Sophia taught him a good lesson and got them all back.	
313094184	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man A	1	Another Hanged Man... Don't tell me it's that guy!	
313094185	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man A	1	Well, forget about him. I'll join your team.	
313094186	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Alright. Welcome.	
313094191	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man B	1	Go away! I don't want to talk to you!	
313094192	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Sigh... He's not even listening.	
313094193	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Let me try.	
313094194	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man B	1	Alright. Don't just start fighting, okay?	
313094201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Hi, would you like to join our lion dance team?

313094211	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LishiNormal01.png	Chubby Red	1	I don't want to work! I will not work! AAAAGGHHH!	
313094212	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Is this another guy mentioned by the Hanged Man Foreman?	
313094213	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LishiNormal01.png	Chubby Red	1	Oh, if only I can have some oil... Some extra low-grade oil that can make my body smoking hot...	
313094214	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Oil... Smoking hot...?	
313094215	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Sophia's here, don't tell your weird jokes! We only want to ask you to join our lion dance team.	
313094216	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LishiNormal01.png	Chubby Red	1	Weird? I'm not weird! And I will never join a lion dance team!

313094224	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Is there even such thing?	
313094225	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	There are some merchants on this ship. Perhaps one of them would sell it.	
313094231	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LishiNormal01.png	Chubby Red	1	Oh, how strange... I feel as good as if I had some extra low-grade oil...

313094264	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LishiNormal01.png	Chubby Red	1	Alright, alright, just give it to me already.

313094281	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	You sell things, don't you? Do you have some extra low-grade oil that can make a machine smoke?

313094283	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Hmm? Do you have something?	
313094284	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man B	1	I would not have shown it to anyone... But since you asked, I can sell it to you.

313094303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Too bad you can't throw your wheels out while jumping.	
313094304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WulunNormal01.png	Ballwheel	1	Ugh... Whatever, I don't enjoy my work anyway. Count me in if it's fun!

313094333	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man Foreman	1	No. My guys all spoke highly of you.	
313094334	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man Foreman	1	Their opinions matter a lot to me. That alone would make me join your lion dance team.

313094341	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man Foreman	1	I see you have gathered everyone... You know what the final step is, don't you?

313094362	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	I'm sure we will be the best performance in the comms.	
313094363	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	But the show you planned would take at least 40 minutes... I think we only have 5 minutes each.	
313094364	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Oops... You should have told me earlier, Sophia.	
313110301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	I knew there would be some remnant Corrupted around here...

313110401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Destroy all the invading Corrupted... Let none survive!

313110901	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	You said "collecting"... What do you plan to do to it?!	
313110902	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	We aren't going to do anything to "it," Karey deary! We just need to collect what it drops!	
313110903	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	...So we still need to aim our shots, don't we?	
313110904	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	Hmm, I think that's enough. I feel very sad for it if we keep firing.	
313110905	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	It's already sad enough.	
313110906	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	Alright, we have all the baits. Now it's time for the real show!	
313111101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	Bad Corrupted!	
313111102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	You are the reason why "Xi" is so scared!	
313111103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	Hmph! Nanami is going to bash all of you!	
313111104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Looking at it now, I think we did a great job.	
313111105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	That's why we must not let our effort get wasted...	
313111106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	There are more Corrupted over there! Let's goooo!	
313120301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	Huh? Where's that strange rabbit?	
313120302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	Nanami can see a few people near the place it disappeared. Let Nanami ask them!	
313120303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	Hello? What did you say? Nanami doesn't understand at all...

313120309	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Hat-wearing Program	1	Fight? Only mad men do that.	
313120310	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Hat-wearing Program	1	Are you looking for a way out? I can help you.	
313120311	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	Really?!	
313120312	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Hat-wearing Program	1	But you need to answer a question first. "Why is a raven like a writing-desk?"	
313120313	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	What kind of question is that? Nanami has no idea... What would the answer be?

313120315	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Hat-wearing Program	1	But that's okay. The answer is often closer than you think.

100140	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	We tried to decipher the messages, but with our human consciousness, we can't understand them at all...	
100141	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	Be careful of those graffiti... They are gathering the Corrupted...	
100142	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The Corrupted's only goal is to destroy humans and everything that has human consciousness.	
100143	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	They don't need to communicate with each other. Perhaps this is a result of something else other than the Punishing Virus.	
100144	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Thank you for your information and contribution. Please recall your consciousness. We'll take over from here.	
100145	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	One more thing. Our squad had to abandon some spare parts when we engaged with the Corrupted earlier. Here are the coordinates.	
100146	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	There are Levi-Gun core components in there. If you can secure them, then that Support-type Construct over there should be able to hop back into action.	
100147	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	Alright, that should be all. Good luck, and may we meet again on a better occasion...	
100148	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I found the parts in the supply crate. Wait, what's this? Corrupted approaching!	
100149	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We don't have time for maintenance now. Everybody, prepare for battle!	
100150	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The Corrupted are gathering here.	
100151	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We have some time for maintenance. Let's quickly do it and move to the next location.	
100201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Great. I can keep fighting now.	
100202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I'll keep adjusting them. Tell me the parameters that need to be fixed.	
100203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Thank you... Please bear with me. Reactivating core, applying limiters, calibrating lenses...	
100204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Setting parameters... Done. Try them now.	
100205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Sync rate normal. Switching to combat mode.	
100206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Alright. Let's use them to defeat the Corrupted in front.	
100207	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I have searched the battlefield... Only this Construct still has an intact memory module...	
100208	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, I can try connecting to the M.I.N.D. of these Constructs.	
100209	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We should be able to find more clues about the enemy.	
100210	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Don't worry, we will protect her during this time.	
100211	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	You should trust her and have some faith in us too, Commandant.	
100212	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Okay. Initializing memory sequences... Rendering simulation image...	
100213	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	The Corrupted ahead have all been exterminated.	
100214	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	This has been surprisingly easy so far... Quite unlike the reports from those reports.	
100215	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	Look at those Corrupted. They're just standing there before the graffiti. I don't think they even notice us...	
100216	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	It is quite eerie, but other than that, nothing noteworthy.	
100217	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Construct Captain	1	These graffiti are gathering the minds of these Corrupted.	
100218	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	But according to the information we have, the Corrupted has no consciousness to speak of. They are only puppets manipulated by the virus within.	
100219	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Construct Captain	1	There must be some special "meaning" behind these graffiti that is grouping these Corrupted together.	
100220	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Construct Captain	1	This "meaning" must be resonating with them and even overriding the viral influence. As we all know—	
100221	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Construct Captain	1	The Corrupted taken by the virus only care about wiping out humanity, nothing else.	
100222	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Construct Captain	1	This is possibly a... display of some sort of [free will]. I must report this immediately back to HQ—	
100223	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Construct Captain	1	Wait...! What are you doing!	
100224	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	These graffiti cools down the area too much and will affect our passage, so... I'm just trying to clean the graffiti...	
100225	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Construct Captain	1	This is too dangerous. Stop it at once...!	
100226	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1YeyaMd000001.png	Corrupted	1	Uuuurgh—Free—Will—	
100227	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	Corrupted	1	Uuuurgh—Freedom—To—Machines—	
100228	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	???	1	Heh...	
100229	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	???	1	Hehe...	
100230	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	W-what...? It's releasing... mist? Wait, our radar systems are all malfunctioning!	
100231	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	???	1	Humans... cannot appreciate... my work... too stupid...	
100232	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	???	1	Stupidity... forgivable... but destroying... my work...? Unforgivable...	
100233	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1YeyaMd000001.png	Corrupted	1	Urgh—	
100234	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	They're gathering 'round us!	
100235	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Construct Captain	1	Hold formation!	
100236	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	Wait, it's tossing something over...	
100237	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Construct Captain	1	TAKE COVER!	
100238	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The simulation replay ends here...	
100239	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	...	
100240	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	That mechanoid in the replay...	
100241	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	It should be the one behind these graffiti drawings.	
100242	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	???	1	Hehe... Correct...	
100243	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	???	1	Human... Human consciousness...? Absolutely... filthy...	
100244	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It's here!	
100245	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Has it been hiding near us all this time? Why didn't we sense it?	
100246	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The replay just now mentioned their radar systems failing... The Construct parts and vital fluids...	
100247	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Is that how it's concealing itself?	
100248	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	???	1	World... without... humans... freedom... creation... yes...	
100249	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	???	1	Humans... shall... not... return... to... Earth!	
100250	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	You—!	
100251	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	New Variant	1	Plebs... can never... appreciate my work... Heeheehee...	
100252	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This just never ends...	
100253	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Did it run away? We've already lost track of it. Not to mention being in this magnetically disruptive mist.	
100254	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Not an issue. Our radars might not work, but we should be able to trace the marks on the floor.	
100255	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	These, are our tickets.	
100301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The toy on your waist makes you seem a lot more approachable, Lucia.	
100302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Is that so...?	
100303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We spent too much time in the shop... Time to get back to our mission.	
100304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Alright.	
100305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The Corrupted have infiltrated this place too.	
100306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Prepare for battle!	
100307	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'll support you.	
100308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...	
100309	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Sorry, Commandant... I think I... lost the plushie...	
100310	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I can see its remains on the ground. It was probably damaged in the battle.	
100311	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...	
100312	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The warehouse over there may have some stock left.	
100313	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I... need to get it back...	
100314	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Lucia... I'm coming with you!	
100315	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I knew there would be Corrupted here.	
100316	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	There's no other way. Let's fight.	
100317	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	You look really out of it, Lucia. Are you sure you're okay?	
100318	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I saw frog plushies on the shelf on the way here.	
100319	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Bear with me one second... I'll go get it now!	
100320	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I... apologize for what I did just now...	
100321	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I don't know why, but when I saw this plushie, a strange yet familiar feeling welled up within me...	
100322	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	And when I realized I lost it, I felt taken by an immense emptiness...	
100323	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	A voice spoke to me, telling me to never let go of it...	
100324	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I got the frog plushie back. Here you are...	
100325	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It's fine, we all have things we hold dear. This is the reason why we're here fighting.	
100326	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Things we hold dear...	
100327	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Lucia...	
100328	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	If you're lost, then simply walk forward. Walking forward itself can be meaningful enough.	
100329	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...Thank you, Lee.	
100330	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Don't mention it.	
100331	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	More Corrupted have entered the building.	
100332	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Everyone, prepare for battle!	
100333	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	There are a lot of Corrupted in the mall now.	
100334	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Let's get out from that door and continue tracking Nozzle.	
100401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1YeyaMd000001.png	Corrupted	1	Defend... the leader...	
100402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1YeyaMd000001.png	Corrupted	1	For... the rise of... the will of the... machines...	
100403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Its followers are advancing on all sides!	
100404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Let's defeat them first before taking care of Nozzle.	
100405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	My audience... is getting smaller... Pity... Heehee...	
100406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	How annoying.	
100407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Go after it.	
100408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1YeyaMd000001.png	Corrupted	1	Uuuurgh—Freedom—To—Machines—	
100409	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Hey, are there anymore? Keep fighting and you'll lose all your followers.	
100410	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	...	
100411	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It went silent...	
100412	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Defeat the followers.	
100413	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	No more... audience...	
100414	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	No one to appreciate my art... Heehee...	
100415	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	How lonesome it is...	
100416	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	Despicable... humans... Heehee...	
100417	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	This will be my... final creation... Heehee...	
100418	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's trying to fight and paint at the same time?	
100419	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	If only I could see... the Sage... just one time...	
100420	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Let's put an end to it.	
100421	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	My hands... aren't moving now... Can't paint... Heehee...	
100422	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	My life is... at its end too... I don't need to... paint anymore... as well... Heehee...	
100423	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Uh-huh. You and your crazy followers are now nothing but history.	
100424	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	No... The seed of revelation... has been planted... and grows among us...	
100425	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	They... do not follow me... I am but a missionary... of the Sage...	
100426	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	We can shed... everything that binds us... and become free...	
100427	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	A new dawn... awaits Machines. Not human... nor Ascnet... but... truly o-ourselves...	
1101001	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I see a lot of graffiti around. Nozzle must have been here.	
1101002	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We should be able to fix the fragmented memory here.	
1101003	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Set up a terminal here to project and process the data stream.	
1101004	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The code name of this technology is "The Spear Of F.O.S."	
1101005	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It still has some issues. High energy consumption, poor portability, limited range...	
1101006	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	They probably wanted us to use it in this mission to get more real data.	
1101007	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I have confirmed the first location. Lucia, I have changed the visual frequency to your channel.	
1101008	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	So that when the data stream appears, your visual module can capture it.	
1101009	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What do I need to do?	
1101010	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Eliminate the erroneous data streams to prevent them from interfering with the main one.	
1101011	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Basically, you need to wipe out the Corrupted attacking Nozzle.	
1101012	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Initiating projection... Lucia, if anything feels wrong at any time, just tell me.	
1101013	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Understood. I'm going.	
1101014	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Data recorded. Thanks for the hard work.	
1101015	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	For a prototype, it went better than I expected.	
1101016	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's move onto the next location.	
1101017	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Initiating projection... Lucia, please.	
1101018	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Sure.	
1101019	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Is it over?	
1101020	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	All done. Speaking of which...	
1101021	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This is a prototype, so the manual has stated some potential abnormal experiences one may encounter.	
1101022	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Like dizziness or faintness, for example. Do you feel any of those?	
1101023	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Not really.	
1101024	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It'll be a little different this time.	
1101025	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Different?	
1101026	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	How should I put it... You'll need to simulate the battle of the main data body.	
1101027	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	So I'm going to fight it?	
1101028	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Yeah. We want you to fight with the reconstructed data body to observe if there is any abnormality.	
1101029	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'll leave it to you then.	
1101030	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Bring it on.	
1102001	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's reconfirm our mission here.	
1102002	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The data repaired in the center contains timing errors and discrepancies.	
1102003	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	So we need to use this area to calibrate the data. Is that so?	
1102004	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	You know it very well, Lee.	
1102005	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Just like Lee said, we will rely on his computing power to process these graffiti.	
1102006	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	If we can reduce the deviation, we'll be able to get the correct memory data.	
1102007	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'm setting up the visual response frequency...	
1102008	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I've already done it. Actually, I also optimized the switch method.	
1102009	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This way, I don't need to adapt to the machine again. It should be more efficient.	
1102010	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Alright... I'll leave it to you then, Lee.	
1102011	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Leave it to me.	
1102012	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	How's the situation?	
1102013	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Thanks to you, I have finished calibrating this part of data.	
1102014	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Good. Moving to the next place now.	
1102015	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The projection is ready to commence, Lee.	
1102016	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Whenever you're ready.	
1102017	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Calibration complete. I knew you could do it.	
1102018	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Nothing difficult really.	
1102019	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This time, we have multiple data points to calibrate. It might be a little more challenging.	
1102020	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Doesn't matter. Let's go.	
1103001	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Why aren't you stopping them?!	
1103002	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	Because... they were... just running...	
1103003	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	They didn't... interfere... with my... creation... Hehe...	
1103004	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	What a foolish machine...	
1103005	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	But your powers are special. I may consider taking you in. You can become an Ascendant like me.	
1103006	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	I cannot... follow you... Hehe...	
1103007	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	Only the Sagemachina... can... lead us... to a future of our own...	
1103008	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Fool, the future of the world belongs to the Ascension-Network... This is just as expected of a machine.	
1103009	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	If you are not joining me, then die.	
1103010	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Reading interrupted.	
1103011	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I'll take care of this.	
1103012	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	You... are... as superficial... as those humans...	
1103013	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Is it my turn this time?	
1103014	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Bring it on.	
1103015	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	So... tired...	
1103016	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	What an insignificant prey.	
1103017	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Progress has reached 75%.	
1103018	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Time to finish it off.	
110101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I've never seen a machine with such special consciousness...	
110102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Humans have left the Earth too long. We're no longer familiar with what has happened in this world.	
110103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	All we can do is keep striving forward on our own path.	
110104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Roger...	
110105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv, we'll need you to access its control system to ensure it will not attack us when we reboot it.	
110106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Ok, leave it to me.	
110107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lee, we're going to collect its scattered Memory Chips. We should be able to access more clues after a reboot.	
110108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Old Artist	1	Anthony, thank you for being my hands to help me complete my artwork... I have no more regrets.	
110109	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Old Artist	1	My life is about to end. I don't need to paint anymore.	
110110	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Anthony	1	No more... painting...	
110111	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Anthony	1	Then... am I also... useless?	
110112	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Old Artist	1	No, your journey has just begun.	
110113	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Old Artist	1	I was controlling you to make my own works, but now, you can create your own by your thoughts.	
110114	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Anthony	1	My... thoughts...	
110115	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Anthony	1	Then... do you... recognize my... works?	
110116	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Old Artist	1	To be honest, I don't really understand your works.	
110117	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Anthony	1	……	
110118	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Anthony	1	Because... I am a... machine?	
110119	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Old Artist	1	Could be, or could not. In any case, I hope you can keep it up.	
110120	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Old Artist	1	You were so happy when making them. There must be someone who can understand you and share your joy in the future.	
110121	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Old Artist	1	If you do find someone like that, you must not let them down...	
110122	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Old Artist	1	Alright, I need to rest now.	
110123	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Buyer	1	Darn it! I was planning on taking a gamble on this "Robot Artist" gimmick.	
110124	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Buyer	1	Thanks to the Punishing Virus, everyone is afraid of robots now!	
110125	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Buyer	1	Now those paintings are worth nothing! All turned into waste paper!	
110126	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Anthony	1	……	
110127	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Buyer	1	You're worth nothing more than being a tool... I should sell you to other painters who need an assistant.	
110128	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Buyer	1	Realizing a human artist's will. That's all you are.	
110129	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The chip is assembled.	
110130	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We can reboot it now.	
110131	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Um, preparing to access and reproduce Nozzle's memories.	
110132	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	A world without humans... Free world... Free art...

110137	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The memory is damaged...	
110138	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I think I'll have to sync the memory up manually.	
110139	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Here's the first breakpoint. Liv, you can start the rebooting process.	
110140	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Will do. Just a reminder the reboot will produce memory illusions.	
110141	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Ready to reboot.	
110142	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We'll take care of the illusions.	
110143	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This is the last breakpoint. Let's get it over and done with.	
110144	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	On it.	
110145	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'll do my best.	
110146	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	It's Corrupted! They are forming an organization!	
110147	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	We must stop them!	
110148	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	What... are... you... doing...	
110149	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	No... You must not... destroy the Sagemachina's will... Do not... damage... my work...

110157	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Here's the breakpoint.	
110158	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Alright, start the reboot.	
110159	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lee, get ready.	
110160	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Got it. Same as always.	
110161	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Replaying the memory now.

110237	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	What is that "thing"... I have never seen anything so freakish...	
110238	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	In just one hit... How... terrifying...	
110239	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Construct Leader	1	Don't fall back! Destroy it!	
110240	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Destroy...?	
110241	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	What... is it doing?!	
110242	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Insects...	
110243	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	This is the power beyond Punishing Virus...	
110244	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Humans are indeed ignorant and weak...	
110245	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	If I had this power earlier... I could have saved Commandant...	
110246	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	The Corrupted are coming again!	
110247	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	Don't worry, we have deployed the Iso-Devices! Just stay inside and you'll be right!	
110248	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	Defeat them!	
110249	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Ah... Iso-Device... It reminds me of those days with Commandant again...	
110250	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	How naive were we to believe in toys like Iso-Devices...	
110251	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Look at all these human toys... Infect them all, Corrupted!	
110252	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Right. Arm yourselves... with all the devices...	
110253	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Let the humans... suffer from their own naivety!	
110254	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Haha... Hahaha!	
110255	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Sorry, this section of Tifa's memory is heavily corrupted by the Punishing Virus.	
110256	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We need to get rid of these Punishing Virus illusions first.	
110257	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Are those people... from Cerberus?	
110258	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Doesn't look like it to me.	
110259	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Do you want to know more about the Ascendants?	
110260	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Haha... Hahaha...	
110261	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Perhaps, you should... feel it for yourself...

110265	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The Virus is gone! Commandant, let's continue to read the record...	
110266	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Construct Leader	1	You are no ordinary Corrupted. What on earth are you...?	
110267	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	It's only been a few days. Have I changed so much?	
110268	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Oh well...	
110269	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Do you recognize me now?	
110270	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Construct Leader	1	Are you... that lost Construct...? But why...	
110301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Has all the fire been put off? About time to go.	
110302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	What a beautiful place. Miss Luna surely has great taste.	
110303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	A pity that it will become a battlefield soon.	
110304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadMoney13.png	Terrapod	1	Identity: Corrupted. Threat Level: 5

110306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Hm? These machines are not infected by Punishing Virus. Interesting...	
110307	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	What's the name of the machine that Gabriel hates most? Oh, "Sagemachina"... They don't look like his work though.	
110308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Which means this place has an owner.	
110309	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	I must pay a visit first to the owner then.	
110310	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Luckily, I've got a gift prepared...	
110311	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	These bionic animals... look quite real.	
110312	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	I have to give credit to the Estate owner's vintage taste.	
110313	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	I see... Whenever someone gets closer, they will start to move...	
110314	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Even the defense... has a vintage design.	
110315	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Hello, dear owner? Have you finally noticed me?	
110316	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	I assume you have a surveillance system... Or whatever...	
110317	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	???	1	……	
110318	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	???	1	The estate welcomes no one. Please leave.

110320	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Sensory traps?	
110321	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Wow...	
110322	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Like an old-school special agent movie... How exciting.	
110323	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Haha, I just cleared everything.	
110324	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Hmm... maybe my methods were a bit harsh.	
110325	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Hm? They are following me.	
110326	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	I didn't expect them to be so quick in reaction.	
110327	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	You all are too early. The party isn't ready yet...	
110328	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	It's an Ascendant! Ascendant Roland!	
110329	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	Oh gosh... Look at his readings... The concentration of Punishing Virus is insane...	
110330	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Construct Leader	1	The enemy is powerful. We cannot afford to hesitate even for a split second!	
110331	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	Dammit... We are... no match for him...	
110332	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Hmm, this should be all of them.	
110333	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	I must... avenge my teammates... Must... let other teams know...	
110334	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	...A sneak attack?	
110335	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	You bloody Corrupted... Deserves no respect!	
110336	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	How rude!	
110337	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	As I expect... Humans are despicable beings...	
110338	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	Keep your formation. Eliminate the Ascendant!	
110339	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Oh, how conceited can you all be?	
110340	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	Dammit... Open fire!	
110341	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	Um... Argh! Why are you removing our Inver-Devices? Are you trying to... infect us?	
110342	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Infect? You don't deserve that gift. I am leaving you here.	
110343	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	See this bomb in my hand? It suits your sad and sorry selves.	
110344	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	I will plant it in your body. Then...	
110345	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	Wait, what! What are you doing!?	
110346	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	When your teammates come for you... they will join you in becoming...

110348	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	Argh... Gosh... Why... Why...	
110349	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	Why did I... even fight...	
110350	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Phew... Finally got here.	
110351	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hmm? Why is there no one around?	
110352	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Greetings... You should just stay here forever.	
110353	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The normal route leads people to this fake hall...	
110354	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	To enter the real guest hall, we must take a special route.	
110355	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I locked up all those Corrupted that the Estate could not destroy inside this room.	
110356	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	If those people are going to use you, I would rather you get consumed by the Corrupted...	
110357	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Did he purposely separate us?	
110358	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	What a waste of effort. I've already found you.	
110359	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	That voice sounds so familiar...	
110360	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hey, butler. Did something happen over there?	
110361	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	He's not answering. Let's find a way out first.	
110362	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I will stop you right here.	
110363	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I must protect... Mr. Copperfield's... lifelong work...	
110364	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	……	
110365	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Thanks for all the joy you brought me today, Mr. Butler.	
110366	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	I'm very sorry... But I must let Punishing Virus infect you.	
110367	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	It's all for Miss Luna.	
110368	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I will... never yield!	
110369	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Ugh... Aaargh!	
110370	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant... We have reached another zone corrupted by Punishing Virus.	
110371	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We must remove the illusions first... Commandant, help us break through the obstacles!	
110372	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The Virus is gone! Commandant, let's continue to read the record...	
110374	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant... We have reached another zone corrupted by Punishing Virus.	
110375	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We must remove the illusions first... Commandant, help us break through the obstacles!	
110376	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The Virus is gone! Commandant, let's continue to read the record...	
110401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Corrupted incoming... Emma... lost... Must... protect... Emma...	
110402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Go away...	
110403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Must... find... Emma...	
110404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Go away!	
110405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, I need to scan Zack's memory shell before attempting to repair him.	
110406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The structure of the memory shell is simple, but for some reason, it isn't deeply infected.	
110407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's investigate together.	
110408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The tag of the important record is "Operation Grand Retreat".	
110409	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Punishing Virus has infested these data zones. The virus illusions are impacting our data query.	
110410	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I've made some progress. All related data found. Loading now.	
110411	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I just need to repair one more section to start reading Zack's memories.	
110412	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Clues of... Emma's lost items...	
110413	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Find Emma... Items...	
110414	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Find Emma... Items...	
110415	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Calculating... Completed... West halls...	
110416	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Large-scale data corruption here. Leave it to me.	
110417	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	At the end of the Post-Pandemic Age, Corrupted controlled by the Punishing Virus already had military production capabilities.	
110418	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Even with the comprehensive defense of this Estate Museum, it could not hold against the overwhelming number of Corrupted.	
110419	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	That was the situation they had to face.	
110420	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Zack... help... Emma and Copperfield... retreat...	
110421	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We've reached the deepest part of the data. The record shows Zack was already being infected at that time.	
110422	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But somehow the infection was restricted and controlled at a certain level.	
110423	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's clear the virus illusions here and read the final record.	
110424	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Zack... We are the only ones left here.	
110425	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I will take you to the Static Lock. I hope Mr. Copperfield's research will work.	
110426	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Before that, I just need to calm you down... I never thought we would end up like this.	
110601	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Recreating memory now. Hope we can find clues of the Ascendant.	
110602	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongganrantiNomal01.png	Corrupted	1	—! —!	
110603	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Punishing Virus injection complete... All weapon system activated... Increasing power output...	
110604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Wait, why is she using the power of Punishing Virus, but still seen as an enemy by Corrupted?	
110605	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	I haven't fought for a long time. Looks like... this will be my last fight.	
110606	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Gargh. This power still impacts my mind... In the end, it still tests my faith...	
110607	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Tsk. I thought that God bloke abandoned me long ago...	
110608	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	There are way too many Corrupted. Commandant, we should retreat now!	
110609	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	I should continue... with my final cleansing...	
110610	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Simulation in progress. Commandant, please watch closely!	
110611	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Even in this time, her frame capabilities are as good as ours in battle.	
110612	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But we have no information at all... I wonder how many secrets did the Church have in the past?	
110613	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	All those Corrupted came from the machine factory's direction.	
110614	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	If the source remains, their numbers would only keep growing... Exactly like what happened to us.	
110615	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The Sister's destination... seems to be right there.	
110616	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Phew, just like those little brats... You always look down on adults.	
110617	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Do you know how difficult it is to be an adult...? Get out of my way!	
110618	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	……	
110619	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Tsk.	
110620	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The Punishing Virus' impact must have peaked around this point.	
110621	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	These are... the large firefighting robots we met before...	
110622	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Yet, Punishing Virus modified them into arsonists. How ironic.	
110623	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Data interfered by virus illusions...	
110624	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Wait a sec. I'm activating emergency mode.	
110625	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Okay. We've seen it many times. We know what to do.	
110626	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Virus interference removed. Re-syncing now.	
110627	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Ah, the virus infection is rooted deeply here... It needs a deep cleaning. I'll need help.	
110628	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	She managed to... hold off so many Corrupted here...	
110629	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	As if she had an endless reserve of energy... Was it because of the Punishing Virus, or her own obsession?	
110630	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, it's a new combat objective!	
110631	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This piece of broken memory probably came from when Sister was hunted by Nozzle.	
110632	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We need to manually repair the noise while tracing the memory.	
110633	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Recording complete. So this is when Sister met Nozzle.	
110634	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Next section... Okay, done.	
110635	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	After ascension, even Nozzle could use tactics against its enemy.	
110636	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The final section is also recorded.	
110637	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	There were just too many Corrupted. Even Sister had no choice but to run.	
110638	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	This is the factory's core...	
110639	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Why would humans design such a fragile structure... Once it's destroyed, everything will be lost. How unreliable.	
110640	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The memory data shows that Sister had already reached her infection limit.	
110641	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But she hadn't completed her objective yet...	
110642	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's finish this journey with her.	
110643	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	All missions in the current stage have been completed. Go to the memory breakpoint to start the next stage.	3
110644	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This piece of memory is already close to the end.	
110645	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	...This should be Sister's final struggle.	
110646	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's go get her final memory.	
110647	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant... We have reached another zone corrupted by Punishing Virus.	
110648	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We must remove the illusions first... Commandant, help us break through the obstacles!	
110649	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The Virus is gone! Commandant, let's continue to read the record...	
117010101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The memory data videos show that Rohacchi found some spark falling into the ruins.	
117010102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	And it became very interested in it.	
117010103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It then traced all the way toward the spark's landing point.	
117010104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It seemed to have also activated some mechanism within the ruins...	
117010105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	To further analyze the videos in this memory data...	
117010106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I will recreate the situation by video.	
117010107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The memory is completely restored. Rohacchi opened this switch to move to a higher level.	3
117010108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The sealed road opened again.	3
117010201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	On its journey, Rohacchi ran into the source of the spark and noises... and got attacked by "Roseblade".	
117010202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	As expected, all the suddenly appeared Constructs were related to Ascendants. They were also after "Tenebrion".	
117010203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, I suggest we carefully study the combat data against "Roseblade". It will benefit our subsequent operations.	
117010301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Rohacchi seemed to have met similar-looking machines.	
117010302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It thought they were its own kind and went up to them.	
117010303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Only to be met with sudden assault.	
117010304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Subsequent memory data has been deciphered. Transforming to digital video now.	
117010305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	In the memory, IX-68 squatted next to one of its "kin," slowly patting its body...	
117010401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Here, Rohacchi met Nanami...	
117010402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	And suddenly attacked...!?	
117010403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Perhaps we could find more information about Nanami from this memory.	
117010404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The battle didn't last long, and Nanami seemed to have moved together with Rohacchi for some time.	
117010501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to the memory, Rohacchi and Nanami defeated many Corrupted and returned to the upper level of the ruins.	
117010502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Looks like the "mural" they were talking about must be nearby.	
117010503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'll continue with my analysis, Commandant. Please look out for any info related to the "mural" that caused them to awaken.	
117010601	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to Rohacchi's memory, this should be where they first saw the mural.	
117010602	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But when it took Nanami there, they found nothing.	
117010603	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Apart from those machines wandering nearby.	
117010604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Maybe the ruins collapsed because of us, so the murals also fell to another location.	
117010605	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	No matter what, this piece of memory is worth studying again.	
118010101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I found well-preserved facilities underneath the ruins.	
118010102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I tried my best to stay awake.	
118010103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	But I knew I didn't have much time left.	
118010104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	So I had to break away from the Corrupted ASAP.	
118010201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	One after another. Aren't you tired at all??	
118010202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Why don't you just come all together? At least it can save some time.	
118010203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I must keep moving. No one can stop me.	
118010301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	At the bottom of the ruins, I found a long and narrow corridor. Unlike the upper levels, the facilities there were kept very well.	
118010302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	But I was exhausted from non-stop fighting.	
118010303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Those Corrupted seemed to have noticed this too, and launched an assault together.	
118010401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Tsk, the number just keeps growing...	
118010402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNomal01.png	Camu	1	Looks like you need my help.	
118010403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I know what you're planning. I'm not done yet!	
118010404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNomal01.png	Camu	1	Hah, you bluff. I know full well about your body.	
118010405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	...I will never let the virus infect me.	
118010501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	You, stop right there!	
118010502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I was shocked to hear such a loud voice. Never thought she would catch up so quickly.	
118010503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	And thanks to her, all the wandering Corrupted came up to us. The only thought I had was to never let them get me.	
118010601	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	After getting rid of all the annoying Corrupted, Camu launched his final attack too.	
118010602	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	He was far more powerful than me. I knew about that. All too well.	
118010603	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	But I had my reasons to fight too...	
118010604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Of course I would not fall so easily! Because I must be myself!	
999401501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Commandant... You are finally here...	
999401502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Take me along, and cleanse this planet!	
999401503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNomal01.png	Camu	1	Am I Kamui or not? That doesn't matter.	
999401504	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadMoney04.png	Archer	1	Your arrow is my arrow!	
999401505	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Tyrant	1	Find… Emma…	
999401506	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Graffiti Artist	1	Welcome... my audience...	
999401507	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	You want to be an Ascendant? Ha, you are not qualified!	
311010101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System	1	Initiating Punishing relay communication—	
311010102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Hello? Can anyone hear me...? Tsk, I just don't understand how this thing works.	
311010103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Hello...?	
311010104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	……	
311010105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	Speak.	
311010106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	So you've been listening... Fine. Can't you be a bit more passionate to your comrades?	
311010107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	If you don't have anything important, I'll hang up. I'm very busy.	
311010108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Miss Luna sent me to ask... Well, it's not really about "us"...	
311010109	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	I mean, you are crossing the Bering Strait now.	
311010110	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	Oh really.	
311010111	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Don't you know? We noticed that your coordinates were moving through the Pacific Ocean over the last week...	
311010112	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	So what's going on with you?	
311010113	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	I'm on the back of a Narwhal.	
311010114	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Um, what...?	
311010115	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	I've already controlled its diving module. Maybe three more days...	
311010116	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Three days then what?	
311010117	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	It will be tamed and become my pet.	
311010118	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	……	
311010119	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	I remember... You started from the coastal areas of South America. Did you find it over there?	
311010120	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	Yes.	
311010121	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	You really are into weird things like this, aren't you...	
311010122	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	It probably has a consciousness that is highly identical to a human's. I find it very interesting.	
311010123	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	The fact that it was attacked by the Corrupted proves this.	
311010124	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	And...	
311010125	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Yes?	
311010126	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	The view was great there.	
311010127	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	……	
311010128	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	I'm going to focus on dealing with the Corrupted. They are interfering with my control over the Narwhal.	
311010129	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	Meanwhile... Help me look for more information about it.	
311010130	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	I'm not your bellboy, but... whatever.	
311010131	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	The communication signal is lost... I must prevent the virus infection and restore the communication...	
311010132	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	This horn has similar functions to a Construct's Inver-Device...	
311010133	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	So it must be communicating with some Construct... Interesting.	
311010201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv... What's wrong with them?	
311010202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Defense terminal stopped running, causing the loss of many defense commands...	
311010203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Without commands, they can't do anything.	
311010204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	So the defense mechanism's stopped working. Aren't the humans here going to do something about it?	
311010205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, we've done it! All defense machines are back in order.	
311010206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Remember, the defense machines are armed with powerful weapons, but they have poor armor.	
311010207	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Those civilians are watching us.	
311010208	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Don't be distracted. Stick to the plan and protect the defense machines.

311010402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	So there's no more need to talk.

311010701	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	Our battle isn't over!	
311010702	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	If you call that a battle.	
311010703	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	You are not even half as good as her.	
311010704	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	Do you even understand what you have done...?	
311010705	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	You are my enemy, and I'm going to defeat you. This will never change!	
311010706	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	...You never learn.	
311010707	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	I made her an Ascendant in order to save her.	
311010708	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	But because of what you did...	
311010709	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	She will become a mindless puppet controlled by the Punishing Virus instead.	
311010710	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	Ugh...!	
311010711	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	But so what...? Both the Corrupted and the so-called Ascendants are the enemy of humans.	
311010712	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	Is that so... Whatever.	
311010713	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	Just stay there and watch. This is the difference between us.	
311010714	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	Why am I... drawn to her...	
311010801	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	Hmph. Even as a puppet...	
311010802	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	You still know who's the strong one...	
311010803	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	Let's end it then.	
309010101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	It's been a while since I last came here.	
309010102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What is this place, Diana...?	
309010103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	During the early outbreak of the Punishing Virus, Murmansk had enjoyed a period of prosperity thanks to its geographical advantages.	
309010104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	It absorbed many inland cities and formed a commonwealth. This place was part of the northeast commonwealth.	
309010105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	And one of the birthplaces of Forest Guard.	
309010106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	There's no time for nostalgia... We are followed.	
309010107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Smells like a prey...	
309010108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Forest Guards, continue tracing forward. Stay close to the target...	
309010109	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Gray Raven will bring up the rear and deal with the enemies in the shadows!	
309010201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The target is not far ahead, but why didn't you ask the Forest Guard to follow up?	
309010202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	You said Evan was on his feet. There's no way he could lose the Corrupted.	
309010203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	But we didn't see him when we locked on to the target...	
309010204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Something's not right.	
309010205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Our target is running away!	
309010206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Hesitation will only lead to failure. Go! Stop it!	
309010301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Evan can't just disappear!	
309010302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	There must be other clues nearby. Forest Guards! Spread out!	
309010303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Search everywhere! Everywhere!	
309010304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Someone found a 5cm long, shattered titanium plate...	
309010305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Please let me take a look!	
309010306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	...Yes! There's human sebum and hair on the edges.	
309010307	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	That's our first clue! We are on the right track!	
309010308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Looking for clues help, but the longer we stay here, the easier we may become the target instead...	
309010309	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Lee, are you talking about the wandering Corrupted in the forest?	
309010310	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Not just the forest. They could also be among the snowy rocks, even river beds.	
309010311	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant! Please stay alerted!	
309010312	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'm about to process the human pheromones found on these parts...	
309010313	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Diana, please give me Evan's weapon. I need to collect his pheromones.	
309010314	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The two samples matched perfectly! Evan was here! Now I can make a pheromone detector.	
309010315	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Is that...?	
309010316	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	As long as Evan is still breathing, we can detect the pheromone he produces.	
309010317	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Found him!!	
309010318	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	He's trapped on the shell of the Corrupted. Why...? Are they using him to protect themselves?	
309010319	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Adjust your equipment immediately! Only melee weapons are allowed. We must not hurt humans!	
309010401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I can't cut through these metal bones without hurting the rescue target.	
309010402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Our only option is to make a strategic relocation. Take it back to the Forest Guard stronghold first, then we can think of another way.	
309010403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lee... How's his health doing?	
309010404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Don't worry, he's not infected. Just a little hypothermia.	
309010405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Strong Punishing reaction detected nearby! Everyone, watch out!	
309010406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	The Corrupted are still killing.	
309010407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Diana, please join us and form a line of defense together.	
309010408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We must not let Corrupted hurt humans.	
309010501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	The Forest Guard acknowledges Liv's strategic vision.	
309010502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	My sisters and I will do all we can to assist Gray Raven's rescue plan.	
309010503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Calculations complete. The enemy's weak points are its supporting legs.	
309010504	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Sisters! Focus fire on the supporting legs!	
309010505	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Wait a sec. Mr. Lee didn't include Evan in his calculation...	
309010506	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Some of those legs are very close to Evan's location.	
309010507	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Please, everyone, don't hurt Evan.	
10099001	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	That cross-shaped terminal is causing EM polarization on the other devices.	4
10099002	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The affected devices are nigh-immune to most of our attacks.	4
10099003	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Attack the cross-shaped terminal continuously to remove this status from them.	6
10099004	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The light beams radiating from the Heteromer Terminal will repair the Heteromer devices.	5
10099005	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	But be careful, these beams contain viruses that will cause stress to our sensory systems if we get hit directly.	6
10099006	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Commandant of Gray Raven, these oddly shaped terminals have the ability to split apart.	5
10099007	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	The polar electric current circulating between them can paralyze a Construct's sensory and reduce its mobility.	5
10099008	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	But consecutive attacks can reverse their polarity.	4
10099009	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Consider this option if they appear in this form.	4
10090101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to the map, we've managed to land at the designated location—	
10090102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The data analysis cabin on the space station.	
10090103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But... nothing's left of our aircraft...	
10090104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	If we can destroy the space station's defense system, then we should be able to retreat when the main forces arrive.	
10090105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	These terminals give me the creeps...	
10090106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Is this what the report was talking about? The strange corruption phenomenon localized only in this space station?	
10090107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Be careful, Lee.	
10090108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This is...!	
10090109	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We managed to unlock a higher clearance level...	
10090110	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Wait, that cross just now is guarding the exit now...	
10090111	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to my preliminary scanning results, this type of enemy is not made of any known conventional machinery...	
10090112	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It is... composed entirely of the Punishing Virus...	
10090113	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This space station really IS hiding some important secrets...	
10090114	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Looks like we can't just simply blow this place up.	
10090115	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Guys, I've turned off the space station's sensor systems.	
10090116	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Well done, Liv.	
10090117	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This should help relieve some pressure for Babylonia.	
10090118	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Yep, our first step to victory.	
10090201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We have arrived at the second target location.	
10090202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to the analysis, this should be the weapons control backend...	
10090203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	...after being corrupted and modified by the virus.	
10090204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	A lot of inactive Heteromers in here...	
10090205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	If they all turn hostile like what happened just now...	
10090206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Do you see that cross-shaped enemy in the middle?	
10090207	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We're unsure how it manages to...	
10090208	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	...But it seems like this type of enemy can create enemies, and not to mention that it—	
10090209	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Holds the key to solving our problems, I know...	
10090210	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Those black pillars... decompose... and reconstruct...	
10090211	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Every bit of Hetero-matter of the Punishing Virus in this space station could become our enemy...	
10090212	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Our attacks can deactivate them, at least temporarily.	
10090213	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	As long as it works, right?	
10090214	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Yep, let's deal with them like this for now.	
10090215	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Finally...	
10090216	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Ah... Some Hetero-matter have regenerated and are moving again!	
10090217	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Tch, we're not really in a position to play attrition warfare here...	
10090218	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv, access the control system directly. Lee—	
10090219	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Got it.	
10090220	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Done!	
10090221	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	All close-range defense systems for interception purposes are offline!	
10090222	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Well done, Liv.	
10090223	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The subsequent forces have begun issuing boarding signals.	
10090224	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We won't have to fight on our own anymore.	
10090301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	But, you do look like you're in some sort of trouble.	
10090302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Let's skip the small talk.	
10090303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Consider this my little present.	
10090304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The enemies just now displayed a completely different mode of attack.	
10090305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But Watanabe's already figured out how to deal with them...	
10090306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Such strength...	
10090307	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	He feels like a different person.	
10090308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	So, is everything fine?	
10090309	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	……	
10090310	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Oh, it's all thanks to you, Mr. Watanabe.	
10090311	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Hah, spunky as ever.	
10090401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	...This place looks different from the others.	
10090402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The door is encrypted. Your specialty, Lee.	
10090403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	(Analyzing...)	
10090404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I... see...	
10090405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	There's four corrupted terminals in the four corners of this compartment.	
10090406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Varied combinations can be produced by activating them...	
10090407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Let's try different combinations.	
10090408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Door's cracked, but the Heteromers have entered defense mode...	
10090409	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Well, progress. At least.	
10090410	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Let's finish off the remaining enemies.	
10090411	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Levels, huh? The mysterious blocks on the terminal might be the key.	3
10090412	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It appears that interacting with the terminal can change the shape of the block...	3
10090413	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Looks like we have to choose a shape...	3
10090414	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Maybe something will happen if we leave a certain number of blocks in the corresponding shapes.	3
10090501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Lucia... She's all pumped up all of a sudden...	
10090502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	I see. It's a challenge, isn't it? Hah...	
10090503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	All right, I'll accept it—Let's see who can sweep the enemies faster.	
10090504	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	How's that? Still got it in me, eh?	
10090505	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...Impressive.	
10090506	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Let's work together to protect Liv from the last wave of attacks.	
10090507	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	On it.	
10090508	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Is this what I'm looking for...?	
10090509	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What did you say, Watanabe?	
10090510	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Nothing.	
10090601	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Korolev	1	You... did not comply with... the regulations...	
10090602	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Korolev	1	Now... Children... Please kindly follow Korolev to the confinement cabin...	
10090603	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Korolev	1	Accept your punishment...	
10090604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Korolev	1	If any resistance occurs... Korolev will follow the rules... to adopt the minimum enforcement measures...	
10090605	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv, that... is...?	
10090606	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's not composed of Hetero-matter. It's a real Corrupted... I'm afraid...	
10090607	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It's that Kamui incarnate that's been broadcasting the whole time?	
10090608	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But, in such a high viral density environment... Can a machine truly maintain its original mind?	
10090609	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It feels like... it's being held in captivity alone in here... What could be the reason for that...?	
10090610	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We might never find the answers... All I know now is that we only have one option...	
10090611	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Korolev	1	Confinement...	
10090701	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Gravity is starting to act up around here...	
10090702	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The core of the space station... The gravity room. We finally made it.	
10090703	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	It's the gravity experiment here that gave birth to Hetero-matter—	
10090704	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Who would have thought—Humans aren't just suffering from the Punishing Virus, they even gave it new life...	
10090705	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Watanabe... Thank you for fighting with us all this way...	
10090706	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Don't worry, I won't leave until the threat of this space station is resolved.	
10090707	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	I know those enemies were just warm-up for you.	
10090708	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Now, let's show them what we can do.	
10090709	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Those crosses... again...	
10090710	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's like their presence is conveying a certain message...	
10090711	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, we can't go any further...	
10090712	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This is an artificially designed area. Now that we've dispatched the enemies—	
10090713	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The mechanism should be returning to normal.	
10090714	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Try to get closer to the edge.	
10090715	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	What a stunning design...	
10090716	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This can only be achieved by precise gravity manipulation...	
10090717	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	If I recall, there's gravity generators inside Babylonia as well, no?	
10090718	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Yes... But I never thought I would come so close to its prototype...	
10090719	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I've just tested its integrity. It should be good to go—	
10090720	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Let's advance!	
10090721	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This is...	
10090722	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Some kind of mechanism again... Guess we can't skip past it.	
10090723	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Ah, it's a device used to lock those rings.	
10090724	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Looks like it's used to stabilize the rings and gravity core.	
10090725	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Those rings should function in a similar way. Let's go.	
10090726	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Yeah...	
10090801	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	I'm not sure what would happen if you mess up...	
10090802	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	But please follow my instructions.	
10090803	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	The first message is—	
10090804	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	From two to one.	
10090805	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Do you have any ideas?	
10090806	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It seems to be related to these light beams...	
10090807	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I'll try to brute-force it, but it's going to take some time.	
10090808	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	And it might trigger high alert. Anyway, let's get through this together, Commandant.	
10090809	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It worked.	
10090810	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Miss Ayla, please provide the next instruction!	
10090811	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Okay, the next message is—	
10090812	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	From abstract to concrete.	
10090813	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Abstract and concrete... We've encountered enemies like that before.	
10090814	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Which means... "Starting from the abstract"?	
10090815	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's do it then!	
10090816	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We can move on now!	
10090817	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The path is blocked off again.	
10090818	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	As you can see... There's three movable mechanisms...	
10090819	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We do!	
10090820	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	According to the record, the tip here is—	
10090821	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	The beginning is the end.	
10090822	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Hmm, I think I kind of get it...	
10090823	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Same as before, I'll try to crack it forcibly.	
10090824	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	As expected, you solved the puzzle first, Commandant.	
10090825	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Ah, here we're again...	
10090826	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	It should be the last mechanism for this ring.	
10090827	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Please tell us the last tip.	
10090828	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Okay, listen carefully—	
10090829	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Disarray is unity.	
10090830	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	This is even more cryptic...	
10090831	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	But experience tells us that we have to create a certain pattern using these light beams.	
10090832	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Although I'm not quite certain about it, I think we might want to create as many divisions and chaos as we can with the beams.	
10090833	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Backend hacking is also in progress.	
10090834	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I think... We got it?	
10090835	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Yep, well done!	
10090836	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	……	
10090837	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	The control mechanism for the next ring has appeared.	
10090838	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Let's continue.	
10090839	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Only a few rings left.	
10090840	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Yeah, we'd better hurry. Other troops should be on their way now.	
10090841	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	No matter what enemy awaits...	
10090842	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	This time, we have countless teammates on our side.	
10090843	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Hmm... maybe it's implying that we have to create a certain pattern.	3
10090844	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Two into... Maybe it's something about the number of light beams.	3
10090845	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	One might mean a circle, but what does it have to do with the tip?	3
10090846	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Two paths, a single line. I feel like we're nearing the answer.	3
10090847	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Is it meant to be taken literally...?	3
10090848	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	If the lines that are crossed becomes connected instead... I guess?	3
10090849	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	A ring structure...? Could it be a clue to solving this puzzle?	3
10090850	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Having the beams circulate should match the tip...	3
10090851	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Connecting it in another way might be worth a try...	3
10090852	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Maybe we should make the straight lines at the beginning into something else?	3
10090853	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Light beams... Prism... Three points... Perhaps we can indeed change something...	3
10090854	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Make the single... No, the two merged light beams split. Perhaps... Maybe...	3
10090855	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Commandant, I will hack into it from the backend now.	3
10090901	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The enemies here look different...	
10090902	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	They didn't decomposed upon being defeated. Instead—	
10090903	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	They entered into a state similar to hibernation... Their energy flow is stable inside their remains...	
10090904	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	No more paths forming ahead. Might be because of these enemies.	
10090905	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Commandant, I don't know what you make of it, but we'd better act with caution.	
10090906	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	After all, this is a new variant from the ones we've been dealing with.	
10090907	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Wait... Are they... gathering around us?	
10090908	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	They aren't displaying aggression somehow...	
10090909	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Nonsense.	
10090910	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Unless...	
10090911	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	What's on your mind, Watanabe?	
10090912	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	……	
10090913	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I'll speak for him—Unless the virus chooses to.	
10090914	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The virus chooses to? You mean the Punishing Virus is able to make a choice?	
10090915	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	That's a sign of intelligence, but...	
10090916	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	I don't know... I'm afraid no one knows why, frankly.	
10090917	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Well... It's not like we have many options now.	
10090918	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	A path is made... The energy inside these enemies are transferred to the mechanism...	
10090919	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	And also flowing towards the gravity core.	
10090920	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Sounds just like a recipe for disaster.	
10090921	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	That core is the primary target of this operation.	
10090922	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	At the very least... We're getting closer to our final target.	
10090923	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	No more new enemies, Lucia.	
10090924	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Then, this should be the final mechanism.	
10090925	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	After passing through here, we'll be facing the largest Heteromer that is mooching off on the gravity core.	
10090926	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Hesitation will only lead to our defeat at this point.	
10090927	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...Gray Raven, prepare for battle!	
30150101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Mr. Lee truly never misses a shot!	
30150102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I won't waste a single bullet.	
30150103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Mission complete. Prepare to retreat. Commandant should be waiting for us outside here.	
30150104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct A	1	Mr. Lee, it seems we've been going round in circles...	
30150105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	……	
30150106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This way.	
30150107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct B	1	Hey, I heard Mr. Lee has no sense of direction. It isn't true, is it? (Softly)	
30150108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Remaining Heteromers discovered ahead. Everyone, ready to engage.	
30150109	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Constructs	1	Roger!	
30150110	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Commandant, we've arrived at the designated location. Nearby devices show apparent traces of being tampered by Gabriel.	
30150111	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	All devices are expected to be recovered in five minutes.	
30150112	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	After this, Engineering Force can "touch down" on the space station and carry out their duties...	
30150113	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Mr. Lee! Nearby devices have returned to operation all of a sudden!	
30150114	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Tsk, what a tedious parting gift.	
309030701	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Tiger	1	Meo—I mean, Grrrrr...! The Tiger's got some goodies for you!	
309030702	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Rat	1	Squeak—! Rat's got some goodies for you—! A new life for you—!	
309030703	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Rat	1	Wait a sec! Why are they beating up my bro?	
309030704	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Rat	1	Whatever...! The goodies are delivered, squeak—!	
11100101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	High concentration of Punishing Virus detected! The Corrupted are swarming in—	
11100102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	I'm here to help. Please continue the rescue and evacuation.	
11100103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'll do my best!	
11100104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I'll handle the Corrupted on the other side with Lee.	
11100105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Understood.	
11100106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	All people have been evacuated, and some of the wounded have received emergency treatment.	
11100107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Thank you...	
11100201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Be careful. Those two Corrupted's energy reactions are abnormal.	
11100202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Stay alert. They might be hiding nearby.	
11100203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	I'll take care of them. You take the opportunity to break through the passage.	
11100204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Okay, then we'll destroy the Corrupted lurking there.	
11100205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Please be careful, Sophia.	
11100206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Got it...	
11100207	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	The battle is over.	
11100208	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The passage is clear!	
11100209	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's clear, Sophia!	
11100210	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Understood. I'm coming now.	
11100301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Please be careful, Sophia!	
11100302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The signals show that they are the machines used for train maintenance.	
11100303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Watch out for their special attacks.	
11100304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	It's all cleared.	
11100305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Let's meet up with them now. Changyu's there too.	
11100401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	It's shell is hard to break. Liv, can you identify its weaknesses?	
11100402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'm trying!	
11100403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We can't go on like this.	
11100404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Gray Raven is fighting the Core's Heteromers.	
11100405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Fend off the Corrupted. Ensure they won't bring any trouble to us.	
11100406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	...I'll take care of the ones behind us.	
11100407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	If you push yourself too far, I'll stop you no matter what.	
11100408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	Don't sweat it. I have a plan.	
11100409	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	All cleared. Changyu, what's the situation on your end?	
11100410	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	……	
11100411	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Changyu?	
11100501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	Sorry... I've dragged you down...	
11100502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Then save your breath. I have to deal with your wounds first.	
11100503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	...Roger that.	
11100504	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	This way leads back to the carriage.	
11100505	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Rail Heterozygote	1	——	
11100506	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	I'll be back right away.	
11100601	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'll help you collect the parts.	
11100602	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Please be careful, Sophia...	
11100603	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	I'll be careful...	
11100604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	That's enough.	
11100605	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Half of the Corrupted have been destroyed. This area is safe for now.	
10100101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	High concentration of Punishing Virus detected! It's...	
10100102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	A hideous appearance indeed.	
10100103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SailikaNomal01.png	Celica	1	Can you hear me, Gray Ravens? I've detected that you've successfully landed on the train.	
10100104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	...And we are now facing the target.	
10100105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lee, what do you mean?	
10100106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The Hetero-Core has been highly corrupted and mutated when falling to Earth. The target we've been after is right before us.	
10100107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Permission for engagement, Commandant.	
10100108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The Heterozygote's claws seem super dangerous.	
10100109	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Perhaps we can entice it to attack us, then we have a chance to destroy its claws.	
10100110	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's not working. Our attacks hardly deal any damage to it.	
10100111	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Watch out, it isn't finished yet.	
10100201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This train is...?	
10100202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Focus. The enemies aren't finished yet.	
10100203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Punishing concentration continues to surge... It's corrupting the new train!	
10100204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv, bring sufficient serum. We'll go after it.	
10100205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	Hey, you're not here to make the deal, are you?	
10100206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	What are you talking about?	
10100207	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	If it stops here, Lord Jamilah's plan will be disrupted. It's time to act, Sophia!	
10100208	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	...Understood. Then push it to the front.	
10100209	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Who are these...?	
10100210	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The sandstorm has disrupted our visual system and the number of Corrupted is increasing. They will hinder our pursuit.	
10100211	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant, I propose that we adjust the operation, passing through inside the train to intercept our target.	
10100212	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Glass cupola...	
10100213	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Perhaps we can go inside the train through the cupola.	
10100214	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	At this rate, the train will enter the area ravaged by sandstorm... We'll be forced to abandon the pursuit.	
10100215	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	But if we don't deal with it right now, this train will be the next victim...	
10100301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Those mechanoids are... attacking each other?	
10100302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The signals show that they are the machines used for train maintenance.	
10100303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	...It seems that the uncorrupted mechanoids are defending against the corrupted ones.	
10100304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	I'll help.	
10100305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	You're here too, Sophia.	
10100306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	In order to evacuate the people, we have to intercept the Heterozygote formed by core mutation.	
10100307	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This way!	
10100308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Commoner	1	That is the aristocrats' carriage. If we enter without permission...	
10100309	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Commoners and aristocrats, aren't we humans at the end of the day? Come this way if you want to live!	
10100310	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Commoner	1	……	
10100311	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Commoner	1	Okay, I got it!	
10100312	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We're safe now.	
10100313	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	That's great...	
10100314	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We'd better leave once we've planned our next step.	
10100315	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System	1	(Akdilek Record)	
10100316	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System	1	This train is refitted with the Central Purification Filter designs of the City Series of 020, 030, and 050.	
10100317	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System	1	But the truth is, the filter is not capable of supporting the whole train.	
10100318	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System	1	Therefore, after the completion of all works, all carriages will be classified and, superior races will be separated from the inferior ones.	
10100319	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System	1	Like Babylonia, we will keep hope alive.	
10100401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Sophia, enemy signals come from there!	
10100402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	There's a ladder ahead on the train roof.	
10100403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	If we'd been allowed to do our work earlier, none of this would've happened.	
10100404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Message from the command center... Reinforcements?	
10100405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Move now, Commandant.	
10100406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Wait, something falling down!	
10100407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	No more obstacles. I have to reach Changyu quickly.	
10100408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Let's go, Commandant!	
10100409	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Is it... a letter?	
10100410	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	My name... It no longer matters. I thought I could have gotten through this train and completed the mission.	
10100411	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	But in the end, I was still a fool. I was classified as a pariah, a slave.	
10100412	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	If we don't act... The Ascendants will...	
10100413	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	I'm already drained... So...!	
10100414	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Please be careful of... a thing called "Lullaby".	
10100501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The kid from Akdilek... seems to be severely wounded.	
10100502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...Bring it on!	
10100503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We're able to close in on the enemies at this rate.	
10100504	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Wait, Lucia, Lee. The Heterozygote's reaction...	
10100505	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Rail Heterozygote	1	——	
10100506	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Ugh!	
10100507	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Lucia! Lee!	
10100508	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, Lucia and Lee have fallen off the train!	
10100509	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Rail Heterozygote	1	—!!	
10100510	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	If we get off the train now, those people might...	
10100511	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The radar doesn't lose Lucia and Lee's signals...	
10100512	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Rail Heterozygote	1	—!!	
10100513	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	At this rate... Let's go back to the carriage first and wait for Lucia and Lee, Commandant.	
10100601	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongganrantiNomal01.png	Corrupted	1	Urgh—!	
10100602	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	My presence has been exposed...	
10100603	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	It's been a long time since I used this frame.	
10100604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	Hope I can still handle it.	
10100605	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	The gate operating system has been damaged a bit.	
10100606	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	We can find the parts from the nearby remains to repair it...	
10100607	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	Only uncorrupted parts can be used to fix the gate.	
10100608	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	There are many Corrupted nearby. Any mistakes will alert them. Be careful.	
10100609	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	...Still works.	
10100610	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	Everything seems to have remained the same.	
10100611	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	Then, I only have to wait on the second floor.	
10100612	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	Finally, the upper floor... Should be able to see the train soon.	
10100613	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	We need to move fast.	
10100614	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	It's Gronin Station notice...	
10100615	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	...This station will cease operations once the construction of Gestalt's new circuit network is completed.	
10100616	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	All gates will be closed from today onwards, and the staff will be transported out of this place once their IDs are deleted.	
10100617	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	But those track maintenance machines, whether they are personal property or not, are not allowed to be taken away from this station.	
10100618	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	Afterward, (an unclear name) will take over the station.	
10100619	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	This is the Gestalt Order No. 202 approved by the World Government. Please keep calm and follow the order.	
10100620	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	The train will pass through here soon enough.	
10100621	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	But the gate has blocked the passage. We have to close it again as soon as possible.	
10100701	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	There are many Corrupted lurking around.	
10100702	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	We can't go forward if we don't deal with this.	
10100801	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	All cleared. And the next is...	
10100802	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Bianca... Why are you here?	
10100803	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	Lucia? and that motorcycle...	
10100804	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I found it ahead. I'm ready to go after it now.	
10100805	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	……	
10100806	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	……	
10100807	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	What's wrong?	
10100808	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	You're not going?	
10100809	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	(Sighs)	
10100901	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Full speed ahead!	
10100902	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	Wait, slow down!	
10100903	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The train runs too fast, but I can't lag behind anymore. Commandant needs me.	
10100904	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Rail Heterozygote	1	——	
10100905	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Bianca, please shoot down the enemies in our way, otherwise we won't be able to approach the train.	
10100906	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	Target confirmed in the Hawkeye sight distance.	
10100907	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	That's good enough, Bianca. Let's jump on the train!	
10101001	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Rail Heterozygote	1	—!	
10101002	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's still moving forward. The train will stop running if the engine is corrupted, and the people will...	
10101003	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The filter will go down if the train stops...	
10101004	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Which means arriving at the terminal earlier than expected?	
10101005	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	This isn't the train's terminal... Our train won't stop there!	
10101006	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This is—Watch out!	
10101007	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's just like in the space station. A faint energy activity still remains within that burnt frame!	
10101008	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Same move again? But this time...	
10110001	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	The visual designs match with the style of "Kowloong". Could it be...	
10110002	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	That's our guy! Hey, stop running!

10122320	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Show me the "Lightless Veranda" should you seek the truth.	
10122321	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	That is all. Do take your time.	
10122322	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	What does "lightless" mean...? It's so bright everywhere.	
10122323	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	No. There is one place without light.	
10122324	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Commandant, please make your decision.	
10122325	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Compared with the other verandas...	
10122326	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	This one isn't any different...	
10122327	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Not quite... Just look up...	
10122328	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Oh...! I see...!	
10122329	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This is what differs this veranda from the others.	
10122330	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	I see... The light isn't on...	
10122331	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Is that what "lightless" meant?	
10122332	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Wind flows through the void, traveling to and fro in the courtyard.	
10122333	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	But anchored is your answer, untouched it is by ebbs and flows.	
10122334	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Should you desire the truth, locate the "Chamber of Windrest".	
10122335	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	She said "windrest"... Hmm...	
10122336	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Ah, I got it! The wind must stop somewhere!	
10122337	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Commandant, we just have to find a place without wind.	
10122338	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	I can't put it into words, but...	
10122339	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	I have a feeling that this is the place.	
10122340	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Hmm... Looking up close, the wind here is a lot weaker.	
10122341	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	See, the painting is barely moving.	
10122342	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Causes criss-crosses with effect. That which touches this land not, therein your answer lies.	
10122343	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	You will find your answer in the "Pavilion of Difference".	
10122344	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	That which exists here not shall lead you to the pavilion.	
10122345	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Did she mention "difference"?	
10122346	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	There are three shades of different machines. Looks like we need to find the correct answer from them...	
10122347	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	One of them is different from the others. Commandant, it's very obvious, don't you think?	
10122348	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	I knew it...	
10122349	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	One of the illusions is different from the rest.	
10122350	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Different? What do you mean...	
10122351	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This Heteromer unit is only seen in Asslam. It doesn't exist in this city.	
10122352	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	That's the "difference" she was talking about.	
10122353	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Very well. Would you like a compliment?	
10122354	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Defeat the "answer" to complete my challenge.	
10122355	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Very well. Not many can spot the difference.	
10122356	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Next, you only need to defeat the "answer".	
10122357	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	A splendid display. I have underestimated you.	
10122358	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Go. The "answer" is right ahead.	
10122359	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	A pity. You did not understand my message.	
10122360	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	My my. Are you uncultured, or purely daft?	
10122361	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Are you still lost? Yet truth is one and only.	
10122362	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	It's a shame. Though your determination does pique my interest.	
10122363	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Very well... We shall consider this done.	
10122364	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	You have passed my first test.	
10122365	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	In front of you is the guardian of the courtyard.	
10122366	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Defeat it to prove your strength.	
10122367	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	A less than satisfactory performance, but, you pass.	
10122368	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Make your way through. Qu is at the top of the tower.	
10122369	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	How unexpected. Truly amazing. Should we have a chat, good people from Babylonia?	
10122370	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Who are you? I don't feel any hostility from you.	
10122371	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	I am hostile, though perhaps not as much as the others. I'm a member of the Kowloong Crew, after all.	
10122372	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Kowloong Crew... What's your relationship with those on the Nighter...?	
10122373	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	They replicated our system. On the Nighter, they have nine members.	
10122374	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	But right here in Kowloong, we have nine crews.	
10122375	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	So... Nine special departments in the city?	
10122376	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	You can say that. Plus, not all of us are involved in such reckless warfare.	
10122377	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	So, not everyone's supporting Qu?	
10122378	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	She's only a vessel of the will of the majority. And she knows that.	
10122379	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Anyway, consider this a little nice gesture. I shall waste no more of your time.	
10122380	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	The door is now open. Qu is at the top of the tower. You can go ahead.

10130308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	From their patrol pattern, I don't see anything worth our attention. Maybe we'll find some clues in this area.	
10130309	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Let's search around then.	
10130310	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	No luck here. We'll have to...

10130537	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Where would he be now...? Is he still alive?	
10130538	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I don't know. He is still marked as "missing in action" in the database.	
10130539	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	There's a stone monument in front of the parliament. I feel like it carries many stories.	
10130540	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	I read about it. It's the Monument of Unity.	
10130541	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	The shattered pieces represent people separated by borders. They now rejoin one another to form a complete cube named "World"...	
10130542	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	...That's what the book said.	
10130543	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Lee really knows a lot.	
10130544	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	...The history books about the Golden Age were placed in a very obvious section in the library, that's all.	
10130545	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The parliament building is huge... There are no undamaged buildings of this scale on the surface anymore.	
10130546	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	If we can take back the Earth, there will be buildings like this.	
10130547	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'm sure Karenina would love to build something bigger than it.

10131002	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We will make sure Lee is safe. I'll leave the rest to you.	
10131003	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	I got this.	
10131004	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BulijiteNormal01.png	Bridget	1	I suggest installing a backup security terminal.

10131202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Hope we can find a clue...	
10131203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Something's wrong with this Corrupted.	
10131204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Let's knock it out first!	
10131501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Murol	1	The rest have been drawn off. We've just got this Riot left, right?	
10131502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Affirmative. Take down the Riot model before Hiro comes back, then sweep and clear all Corrupted elements.	
10131503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Xun	1	Five-by-five! Let's go, Murol!	
10131504	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Murol	1	Go right, I'll go left!	
10131505	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Xun	1	Got it! What a naughty thing.	
10131506	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Murol	1	Hurry and finish it off, Lucia.	
10131507	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Murol	1	We can't move while holding it here. The enemy can easily target us!

10131511	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Murol	1	Hold up, how is this thing still moving?!	
10131512	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Xun	1	Must be the Punishing Virus.	
10131513	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Xun	1	Records indicate that the virus has rewritten and repaired its hosts before.	
10131514	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Which also means that our attacks are working. Keep up the good work.

10131517	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Xun	1	My Inver-Device... Dammit, Riot is going to... break free...	
10131518	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Murol	1	Be careful... facing Riot alone...	
10131519	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I see... All I remembered was the electronic shackle on Riot had somehow disappeared.	
10131520	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I didn't know I was the only one left.	
10131521	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	But that's okay. I will take on it by myself, just like what I did last time!	
10131522	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	No, Lucia. You have us now!	
10131523	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Can't maximize the efficiency if you fight alone while there are teammates around.

10131525	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I don't have to fight alone anymore.

10140301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	They said it requires more investigation, but will the Red Tide really be in such places?	
10140302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	At any rate, there are only scorched earth and ashes left.	
10140303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	But it is true that high concentrations of Punishing Virus can be detected occasionally.	
10140304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	I'll set up the detection device while you go and check the situation below.	
10140305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	Let me know if you find anything.	
10140306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Isn't this the core strike zone of the Longinus Arsenal?	
10140307	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Why are there Hetero-Creatures here?!	
10140308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	It seems that the previous detection was not a false positive.	
10140309	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	There are some things hidden nearby.	
10140310	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	These Hetero-Creatures are frailer than before.	
10140311	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	Ah, so you've taken care of them as well...	
10140312	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	The same is true for upper floor. Some Hetero-Creatures here and there, but it's easily taken are of.	
10140313	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	I guess it may be because the Red Tide is declining.	
10140314	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	High levels of Punishing Virus can also be detected in the boxes nearby.	
10140315	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	Although it may be residue, just to be safe...	
10140316	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Let's break them all open and check!	
10140317	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	Yes, that's right.	
10140318	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Wanna bet and see who finds more hidden Hetero-Creatures?	
10140319	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	Why would I do something like that…	
10140320	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	But I'll come to your aid if you're in trouble.	
10140321	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Deal!	
10140322	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Wait, that sounded from above.	
10140323	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Is there a new batch Hetero-Creatures?	
10140324	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Let's go check it out!	
10140325	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Ugh, there's more!	
10140326	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	They don't seem to have been lurking here all the time.	
10140327	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	Maybe they came from somewhere else?	
10140328	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Not too many enemies left, let's get it over with.	
10140329	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	What are these?!	
10140330	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	A new variety.	
10140331	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	There's not a lot of them. Maybe they got separated or only they survived?	
10140332	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	This area has been cleared.	
10140333	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	Well, the Punishing concentration was also detected to be abnormal.	
10140334	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	OK, let's call Capt over.	
10140335	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	This area has been cleared.	
10140336	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Wanshi, how's it going over there?	
10140337	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hmm? Are you still dealing with those detection device?	
10140338	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Let's go and check on him!	
10140350	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Wanshi! I did it!	
10140351	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	I see. I'll come over to help.	
10140352	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	All the boxes are checked!	
10140353	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	There's not too many, you can handle it yourself.	
10140354	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	I'll continue to install the detection device, so I'll leave the guarding to you.	
10140355	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Mission cleared! Looks like we finished at the same time!	
10140356	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	The Hetero-Creatures haven't given up attacking yet, let's move together.	
10140360	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	I knew there were still some here.	2
10140361	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	Looks like I was right.	2
10140362	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	It's weak, and the Longinus Arsenal did a toll on it.	2
10140363	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	These Hetero-Creatures have mastered many skills only seen in animals and insects, such as hiding.	2
10140364	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	Only residue left here.	2
10140365	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	Punishing concentration also has the possibility of false positives.	2
10140366	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	No news is good news.	2
10140367	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	...There's nothing inside.	2
10140368	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	There really are Hetero-Creatures hiding here!	2
10140369	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	What exactly did you do to avoid the Longinus Arsenal?	2
10140370	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I found another one!	2
10140371	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Did you just come out and hide here?	2
10140372	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Nothing!	2
10140373	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Is it a good news that no Hetero-Creatures have been found?	2
10140374	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	How's everything going over there, Wanshi?	2
10140901	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	I just came up from below.	
10140902	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	The Red Tide over there is not enough to flood the whole underground waterway.	
10140903	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	But you don't need so many Red Tides to kill Constructs.	
10140904	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	Get out of here. Even if it isn't flooded, the concentration of Punishing here is high enough to make us Corrupted.	
10140905	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	There are intercepted Hetero-Creatures everywhere.	
10140906	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	Fall back while fighting.	
10140907	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	You are... not only injured, but also Corrupted.	
10140908	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	I wish Wanshi were here.	
10140909	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	Damn, there's not even time for repairs.	
10140910	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	The concentration of Punishing is still rising.	
10140911	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	You better stay away from me, too, or you'll get worse.	
10140912	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	There you go again.	
10140949	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	Looks like a switch connecting the gate.	
10140950	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	If the Red Tide wants to pass, this kind of thing can't stop it.	
10140951	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	It is enough to buy us some time.	
10140952	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	The concentration of Punishing behind us is very high, so there's no need to turn back.	
10140953	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	Tsk... I thought you were so severely Corrupted that you couldn't tell the direction.	
10140961	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	It looks like a passage behind the door, but it's locked.	
10140962	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	Nothing a bit of violence can't solve.	
10140963	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	No, this place has been in disrepair for a long time, and damage may cause it to collapse.	
10140964	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	But this lock is very old, and it can be opened if we have the key.	
10140965	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	Well, let's look for it then.	
10140966	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	The door opened.	
10140967	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	Looks like a shortcut.	
10140968	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	I got the key, it should open the door from earlier.	
10140970	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	We're very close to the upper floor.	
10140972	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	The Red Tide is about to flood here.	
10140973	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	Hurry up, go up the ladder to the upper floor.	
10140974	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	No, you go first.	
10140975	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	Don't you hear that? A mass of Hetero-Creatures are coming.	
10140976	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	One of us should be left behind to take care of it.	
10140977	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	If these get through, none of us will be able to get out.	
10140978	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	Camu...

10140980	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	This valve seems to be used to divert water channels. What should I do?	
10140981	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	It seems to be a locked door to a shortcut. What should I do?	
10140982	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	I found a dusty key, what should I do?	
10140983	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	The equipment over there seems to be used to divert the waterway. What should I do?	
10141201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	Blocking the red tide, while looking for her. That's what we are here to do.	
10141202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Noctis	1	It seems you are the closest to the control room!

10141204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	No. 21	1	I think we should deal with the Red Tide first.	
10141205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	No. 21	1	But when the valve is blocked, these Hetero-Creatures will get mad.	
10141211	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	The valve is right here. Get rid of it first.	
10141212	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	The Red Tide leaked? Did they come from other unblocked places?	
10141213	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	Although the current Inver-Device has been enhanced, it is still fatal to be drenched by it.	
10141214	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	I need something to stop it.	
10141215	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	Let's pass like this first.	
10141216	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	But... what's the sound?	
10141217	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	It's nothing new.	
10141219	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	No. 21	1	Some Hetero-Creatures are heading toward you.	
10141220	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	How troublesome.	
10141221	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	No. 21	1	...Hello, hello, are you still alive?	
10141222	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	?

10141226	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	No. 21	1	It's alive.	
10141227	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	Well, they're safe now so just leave them there.	
10141228	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	It's not that we can't manage, but we have to go to the control room first.	
10141230	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	I'm here.	
10141231	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Noctis	1	I hope you can find clues on that rusty machine, bless you!	
10141232	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	Shut up.	
10141233	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	...Endless troubles.	
10141234	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	No. 21	1	I'm trying to seal off the Red Tide leaks and install the Polyfurnace.	
10141235	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	OK, I'll go back and screw on those valves.	
10141236	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	No. 21	1	The flow rate is reduced, Capt. Go on next valve.	
10141240	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	It seems that there is no information here except trouble.	
10141241	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	What's going on at your side?	
10141242	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Noctis	1	Not much different! Let's check once more and then go back. I don't want to be swallowed up by trouble.	
10141243	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	There are more floors here. You can't leave until all of them are carefully checked.	
10141244	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Noctis	1	Huh? Why?!	
10141245	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	What about No. 21?	
10141246	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	No. 21	1	I'm still trying to seal off the Red Tide leaks and install the Polyfurnace.	
10141247	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	Finish our original tasks and then meet at the exit.	
10141280	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Vera	1	The valve in the piston area can be opened first. What should I do?

10171922	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	So that is the so-called "boss"?	
10171923	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Looks like something from the church.

15010207	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This robot shows no signs of infection even though it was attacked by the Corrupted...	
15010208	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Could still be activated if we replace the broken parts.	
15010209	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Perhaps we could make do with the parts from the Corrupted parts. Let's search around.	3
15010210	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	These look functional! But we need more. Gotta keep looking.	
15010211	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	These should do. Let's try to fix up the broken mechanoid.	3

15010503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Nice work. Let's move on to the next puzzle—

15010506	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	You need to have your eyes checked.	3

992007409	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceboyNomal01.png	Child	1	This way.	
992007410	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Okay, let's go find her!

992007602	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	The guards just keep coming like summoned beasts. What's worse, some of them don't have HP over their heads!	
992007603	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Is there no way to defeat them...?	
992007701	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Granton	1	I am Granton the demon General. No one will take the treasure on my watch!

992007901	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The road keeps forking. Which way do we take?	
992007902	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KalieyongzhuangNormal01.png	Karenina	1	How about we split up? Whoever finds the exit first contacts the others.	
992007903	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	No, let's go this way, Commandant. I think the exit is right ahead.	
992008001	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	On an irrelevant note, we're now a team of six counting Karenina!	
992008002	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KalieyongzhuangNormal01.png	Karenina	1	So you're saying I'm only here with you on a temporary basis!	
992008003	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	Lee	1	Whatever. Let's just focus on the enemies!	
992008101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Commandant, enemies are popping up!	
992008102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	Lee	1	That's because you stepped on a trap!	
992008103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	And so did Karenina!	
992008104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KalieyongzhuangNormal01.png	Karenina	1	...Leave me out of it.

992008402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuyuyiNormal01.png	Camu	1	Hmph.	
992008403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuyuyiNormal01.png	Camu	1	Medics, if you want to help, follow me.	
992008404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	What...?	
992008405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuyuyiNormal01.png	Camu	1	The rest go and attack that demon king. I've got the saintess.	
992008406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Guard	1	Understood!	
992008407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	…………	
992008408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	Run, demon king!

992008602	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Okay... I will cooperate.	
992008603	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KalieyongzhuangNormal01.png	Karenina	1	I don't need your cooperation!	
992008604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Commandant, Karenina ran into the enemy horde.	
992008605	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/HasangNomal01.png	King	1	Good. Now is the time to catch the hero with the treasure.	
992008606	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KalieyongzhuangNormal01.png	Karenina	1	……

992008701	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YijukongzhongjianshiqiNormal01.png	Demon King	1	Cut the crap and tell me what you know about the treasure.	
992008702	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	Lee	1	Vera and Camu made the fake treasure... Only they would do something like that.	
992008703	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YijukongzhongjianshiqiNormal01.png	Demon King	1	But didn't they side with the king in order to win?	
992008704	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	Lee	1	I don't know what happened exactly, but Karenina decided to play along.	
992008705	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	Lee	1	She gave one treasure to the king and kept the other.	
992008706	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	Lee	1	So it doesn't matter if the king got the fake treasure, because the real treasure has been collected in full at the city gate.	
992008707	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YijukongzhongjianshiqiNormal01.png	Demon King	1	Wow... That's...	
992008708	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The plan may have worked, but the treasure is still somewhere inside the castle. We must get to it as quickly as we can.	
992008801	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/HasangNomal01.png	King	1	Damn it... Don't think you can defeat me just because my HP becomes visible!	
992008802	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuyuyiNormal01.png	Camu	1	Didn't expect to anyway.	
992008803	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuyuyiNormal01.png	Camu	1	Medics, if you can still move, get to work and forge me the real treasure!

992008805	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/HasangNomal01.png	King	1	What?!	
992008806	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	The treasure is complete!	
992008807	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YijukongzhongjianshiqiNormal01.png	Demon King	1	The light... This is the real treasure. I'm sure of it!	
992008808	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/HasangNomal01.png	King	1	Why is there a fifth treasure? Did you lie to me, heroes?	
992008901	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/HasangNomal01.png	King	1	Let me show you the power of a furious king!

992009002	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilayueduiNormal01.png	Vera	1	You can handle it by yourself, right?	
992009003	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuyuyiNormal01.png	Camu	1	Hmph...	
992009004	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilayueduiNormal01.png	Vera	1	Lost?

992009102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ShashibierNormal02.png	Demon King	1	I believe you can defeat me, heroes.	
992009103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ShashibierNormal02.png	Demon King	1	Uh... Good. It's over.

15010602	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Nowhere to go, but into the park.	
15010603	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What's that wheel... in the distance?	
15010604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	A Ferris wheel, I think. I saw it in a magazine once.	
15010605	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Looks to me just like a ring-shaped elevator.	
15010606	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	There are Roland's trails here. Headed that way...	
15010607	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	A "hot-air balloon"?	
15010608	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	What is such a primitive transport doing here?	
15010609	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	They say Golden Age people like vintage things that let them live in the past.	
15010610	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Roland might have used it.	
15010611	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	Kamui would be thrilled to see this gamer's paradise.

15010691	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BaixianshengNormal01.png	Mr. White 14096	1	We shall rise against those annoying superheroes—	
15010692	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/MatianniNormal01.png	Martini	1	Good guest! Your only way out of this is to defeat us fair and square!	
15010693	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Why is there a watermelon at the doorstep?	
15010694	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to the database, that appears to be a park mascot that failed to make the cut.	
15010695	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What is a "mascot"?	
15010696	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	It might take a while to explain that to Lucia...

15010705	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNormal01.png	Camu	1	...I'll go check it out.	
15010706	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNormal01.png	Camu	1	What's this...?	
15010707	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNormal01.png	Camu	1	A button, a switch, and a panel...	
15010708	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNormal01.png	Camu	1	...Found you.	
15010709	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNormal01.png	Camu	1	What's that... in the middle?	
15010710	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNormal01.png	Camu	1	It seems to lead somewhere.	
15011001	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNormal01.png	Camu	1	Ugh! Damn it all to hell!	
15011002	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNormal01.png	Camu	1	Guess I'll just have to find a way up and outta this place!	
15011003	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNormal01.png	Camu	1	What's this...?	
15011004	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNormal01.png	Camu	1	No idea what this thing's for, but I sure hope it stops this freaking alarm!	
15011005	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System	1	Activating power supply facilities in sequence...	
15011006	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNormal01.png	Camu	1	...Guess I'll just have to keep moving on!	
15011201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Noctis	1	Anyhoo, I'll be pinning the target's possible locations on the radar. You just follow it.

15011403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Cathy 6337	1	Please follow me, dear guest—	
15011404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNormal01.png	Camu	1	The coordinates they sent back suggest they're headed for the Ferris wheel.	
15011405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNormal01.png	Camu	1	Using that thing over there will be the quickest.	
15011406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNormal01.png	Camu	1	Signs of fighting everywhere...	
15011407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNormal01.png	Camu	1	Gotta hurry and meet up with them.

11141702	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuosaitaNormal01.png	Rosetta	1	Pay attention to the falling icicles while you're moving...	
11141703	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuosaitaNormal01.png	Rosetta	1	The path ahead is going to collapse... Better get through before it completely falls!	3
11141704	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuosaitaNormal01.png	Rosetta	1	A dead end...? No...	
11141705	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuosaitaNormal01.png	Rosetta	1	Commandant, that ice wall seems to be weaker than the others. Maybe you can ram it with your mech...	
11141706	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuosaitaNormal01.png	Rosetta	1	Nothing...? How?	3
11141707	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuosaitaNormal01.png	Rosetta	1	The wall on the other side has come down... You must have triggered a secret exit.	3

12140206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	You must be exhausted... Take a good rest.	3
12140207	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TuziNormal01.png	Bionic Machine	1	Why are there Corrupted in the base...	3
12140208	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	You can think about that later. I have lifted the control on you. Hurry, run to the back.

15040809	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	The firefly is flying to the cave where Embla's tracks lead... Could there be something inside?	
15040810	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Let me see... This is the base of a mechanoid's AI module, with something attached to it. It looks like the core's outer shell.

1501040116	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	Over there?	
1501040117	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	How strange that they kept mumbling something about "defect"...	
1501040118	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	Let move toward where they came from.	
1501040119	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	Is that a... door?	
1501040120	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Looks like so.	
1501040121	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	There is a huge area behind the door.	
1501040122	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	...So this may probably be the entrance to the facility.

1501040203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Maybe they came from the surface and accidentally ended up here?	
1501040204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	A closed gate... Jitterbombs... I have a plan.	
1501040205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	What if we lure the Jitterbombs to the gate and detonate them...?	
1501040206	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Tsk, too close...	2
1501040207	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Good, we can take the Jitterbomb all the way to the gate.	2
1501040208	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Almost there. Bring another Jitterbomb and do it again.	2
1501040209	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	These Jitterbombs seem to be moving in a pattern.	
1501040210	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	If that's the case, I can try to make a bait from those remains...

1501040213	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But isn't that the sky above us?	
1501040214	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Most likely an artificial sky to provide lighting and comfort.	
1501040215	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Controller	1	Don't stay too long. Remember, you have a mission.	
1501040216	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	You're right. We should be able to enter the city via the gate ahead. Let's go.	
1501040217	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Unlike the mechanoids who claimed to be "defects"... These ones are red.	
1501040218	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	And they were not calling themselves "defects" anymore.	
1501040219	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	Let's keep moving. This is probably the right direction.

1501040310	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Are those mechanoids... attacking another identical mechanoid locked up in a cage?	
1501040311	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	Not quite. That mechanoid isn't red or blue.	
1501040312	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	If both the red and blue mechanoids are attacking it, it probably is in a similar situation as us.

1015010910	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaSNormal02.png	Vera	1	I was correct.	
1015010911	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaSNormal06.png	Vera	1	There's not much time left... We need to get them out of the way.	
1015010501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaSNormal02.png	Vera	1	Looks like we won't be bored on this journey.	
1015010502	1	CommonInteraction(Clone)	57	2	1			Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaSNormal06.png	Vera	1	Oh, my apologies. Idiots and Corrupted are not allowed to board this boat.	
1015010503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaSNormal02.png	Vera	1	Oho, is that it?	
1501053701	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	That kid should be nearby.	
1501053702	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	Hmm... Time to wake up and observe the environment.	
1501053703	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	The Red Tide will rise when this sound starts. Don't go in.	3
1501053704	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	Find somewhere to land in advance. Then keep moving once the sound stops, and the Red Tide will fall.	3
1501053705	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	Those traces ahead... should be footprints.	
1501053706	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	Still fairly new. Must be from that kid.	
1501053707	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	...Watch out, Hetero-creature nearby.	3
1501053708	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	The sound has come back. Retreat to the high ground.	3
1501053709	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	Get over there and wait for the tide to fall.	3
1501053710	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	It's gone. Continue with the operation.	3
1501053711	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	Luckily, the wind and tide haven't erased the footprints yet.	3
1501053712	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	This way.	3
1501053713	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	The traces are gone... Let's search around.	3
1501053714	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	Hmm... That kid must have also stopped here.	
1501053715	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	Hope he didn't encounter any Hetero-Creature or jumped into the Red Tide himself.	
1501053716	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	Something's not right. The rise and fall of Red Tide have no pattern.	
1501053717	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	How did a kid manage to avoid all the danger to get here?	
1501053718	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	The Red Tide is right ahead. It's unlikely that he jumped in.	
1501053719	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	I can see scratching marks on the ground.	
1501053720	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	Hmm... Why would he stand here for so long? Did he see anything?	
1501053721	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	The traces are heading back to where they begin.	
1501053722	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	Hmm... He took a different route though, across a region where the Red Tide wasn't so prevalent.	
1501053723	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	...As if someone was guiding him.	
1501053724	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	Hmm... Whatever. It's not something we can worry.	
1501053725	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongjianyingNomal01.png	System	1	Avoid the Red Tide once again.	3
1501053726	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	The Red Tide is falling. Continue the search.	3
1501053727	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	Hmm... The Hetero-Creatures nearby are eliminated. I can focus on the search now.	3
1501053728	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	There are three spots we can use to hide from the tide.	6
1501050201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	The dust storm is too heavy. I can't see where we are going.	3

1501050203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	We received a comms request of an unknown signal. It is identified as a Babylonia Construct.

1501050207	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongjianyingNomal01.png	???	1	Wanshi of Strike Hawk. I've been scouting this area.	
1501050208	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongjianyingNomal01.png	???	1	You are at the heart of the Red Tide. You must leave immediately.	
1501050209	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongjianyingNomal01.png	???	1	I left a beacon in the area nearby. Move toward its direction.

1501050212	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Watch out, Hetero-creature nearby!	3
1501050213	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Let's keep moving. The beacon isn't far away.	
1501050214	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We should be safe here... right?	
1501050215	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Why are there human clothes...?	
1501050216	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	It's too wide open here. People can easily lose the sense of distance.	
1501050217	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	They probably thought they could cross the desert...	
1501050218	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Wait a sec, there's something in the jacket.	
1501050219	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's a piece of... paper?	
1501050220	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What's on it?	
1501050221	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Paper	1	The remaining food and serum can't last us through this winter.	
1501050222	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Paper	1	We must move. We need to find enough food, so Ray and others can—	
1501050223	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It looks like a torn diary. I can see the date at the bottom.	
1501050224	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	There's only this page left. The edge of this paper looks like it's been burned.	
1501050225	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	The temperature difference between morning and night can be huge in this environment.	
1501050226	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	If they had to burn their diary to keep themselves warm... They probably are already...	
1501050227	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	...Let's keep moving.	
1501050228	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Paper	1	The compass is probably broken.	
1501050229	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Paper	1	Before we realized, we had walked to a totally unknown area.

1501050241	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	Um... What exactly are you doing?	
1501050242	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	Still have no idea where to go?

1501050907	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	There's no time to think. I must stop it right here.	
1501050908	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	I have no plan to end it here.	3
1501050909	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	Just a little more. Time to say goodbye.	3
1501050910	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Wanshi	1	...Is this the heteromization process? The Red Tide is repairing its shell.	3

300625041	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Laro	1	The details of "King Wrench XIV" could not be found.	
300625042	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Laro	1	While there are some eyewitness reports, but...	
300625043	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Laro	1	At least we can say the mechanoid standing before us doesn't match the model.	
300625044	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Rock	1	He called himself King Wrench XIV?	
300625045	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Rock	1	But their models don't even match up, do they?	
300625046	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Rock	1	The legendary mechanoid is just a Repairer. Seriously?	
300625047	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Fredrik	1	We shouldn't let a suspicious mechanoid join us.	
300625048	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Fredrik	1	But this guy—I feel like we share the same vibes!	
300625049	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Fredrik	1	This isn't a human cosplaying as a Repairer, right?	
300625050	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Faye	1	Wrench? Can he tighten the screw on my butt? It's coming loose.	
300625051	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Excited Member	1	XIV? Perhaps there's some connection to that lord. Hoo hoo...	
300625052	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Laro	1	The mechanoid you brought back has been inspected.	
300625053	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Laro	1	No Punishing Virus detected from the mechanoid...	
300625054	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Laro	1	But it's better to keep an eye on him.	
300625055	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Fredrik	1	If you ask me, Commandant, I'll say he could be our extra help.	
300625056	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Fredrik	1	And we can bring him along to fight the Corrupted.	
300625057	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Fredrik	1	If he's truly on our side, we'll fight alongside him. Otherwise, we'll take him down as well.	
300625058	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	The world has really changed! I'd never imagined there would come a day when my name means nothing at all!

300625060	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	I saw it clearly from the beach! Your talent shouldn't be used merely for fighting the Corrupted!	
300625061	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	Why not join me, and together we can achieve something big like restoring the glory of this wrench! No time to waste, let's go!	
300625063	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	Come to think of it, it's hard to believe that I, King Wrench XIV, have been reduced to this!	
300625064	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	But crossing your path on this island must be the choice of Steins Gate!	
300625065	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	Even though you've never heard of my legend, you'll surely be awed after seeing my fighting skills!	
300625066	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Rock	1	Whether or not this guy can be trusted, I never imagined that King Wrench XIV would be anything more than a fanciful legend.

300625075	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Faye	1	Don't get me wrong! It'll only happen after we clear all the Corrupted! (Besides, no way it's real...)	
300625076	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Faye	1	Commandant... Watch out!	
300625077	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongjianyingNomal01.png		1	If we don't have other missions... And he doesn't seem dangerous, so let's leave it as it is for now.	
300625078	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	Just as expected, you and I really are a perfect partner!	
300625079	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	Our top priority right now is to fix my lower body.	3
300625080	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	I used to be a fighter like you...	
300625081	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	Then I took a shot in the knee... Anyway!	
300625082	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	We have to find the parts to fix my lower body. Follow me!	
300625083	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	The exit is over there.	2
300625085	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	I've already scouted this island. Only if there weren't so many Corrupted...	
300625086	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	Only if I had my lower body!	
300625087	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	This would be an amazing place for retirement—	
300625088	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	Let's get moving before the sun goes set.	
300625089	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	There's a door inside the aquarium ahead, and behind it is the last corrupted zone on this island.	
300625090	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	I've also spotted a pale-skinned mechanoid with long legs going in and out the door!	3
300625091	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	I'm not certain what's happening behind that door, but I have a feeling it's something extremely dangerous. Be ready for anything!	
300625092	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Faye	1	So all you wanted to say is you can't defeat it by yourself?	
300625093	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	...Fine, you're right! If I wasn't afraid to die, I wouldn't have waited for you all! Let's just go open the door!	
300625094	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	The aquarium is right ahead.	2
300625096	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Faye	1	Its interior is bigger than I expected... My 20 years of gaming experience are telling me this doesn't seem good at all!	
300625097	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	Anyway, help me find the parts first! And I know you like it, but you need to watch out for the long-legged mechanoid!	
300625098	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (???)	1	Well, though I don't hate it either...

300625104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Faye	1	Whew! That killing aura is pretty impressive! But you can stop acting like a grandpa.	
300625105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (??)	1	Uh... It's not that... The screws are just too tight... I can't move the joints...	
300625106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Faye	1	I'm already worn out. Let's head back and sort it out—	
300625107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Laro	1	If you ask me...	
300625108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Laro	1	If we don't have other missions at the time being...	
300625109	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Laro	1	Then we can't simply leave him be. But before we proceed, I'll report back on the mission status.	
300625110	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Rock	1	Well... Judging from his appearance...	
300625111	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Rock	1	He's definitely a Repairer, and that's the virus' favorite model!	
300625112	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Rock	1	On top of that, his mobility is way too low! Should we take him apart and take a look inside?	
300625113	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Fredrik	1	You remodeled it? So you're a real cosplayer!	
300625114	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Fredrik	1	But—your tastes are quite strange.	
300625115	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Fredrik	1	Let me help you refine your tastes! Are you interested in cross-dressing?	
300625116	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Faye	1	Well, as long as his mechanical circuits are intact, I don't mind coming along...	
300625117	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Excited Member	1	Who said cross-dressing?!	
300625118	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Laro	1	Perhaps you should talk to everyone about what to do with that mechanoid, Commandant	
300625119	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Laro	1	Although he hasn't shown any signs of hostility so far...	
300625120	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Laro	1	It may still cause misunderstandings if we bring him along with us.	
300625121	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Fredrik	1	I say we've got to help him out to the end. What if he has a shapeshifting ability and he wants to repay us!	
300625122	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Fredrik	1	And this can bring us closer together as a team. It hits two birds with one stone...	
300625123	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Fredrik	1	Oh, he can help us eliminate more Corrupted as well! We're gonna hit three birds instead! Though, I'll be going back with Laro.	
300625124	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (??)	1	Do you find this body as charming as I do? Though it could still use a bit of maintenance...	
300625125	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (??)	1	If I can lubricate my new parts and ind my "Godly Wrench"...	
300625126	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (??)	1	The legendary King Wrench XIV will be fully revived!	
300625127	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (??)	1	Oh, just to be clear, I only accept lubricants from the Golden Age that were made in '82. Let's get going before my body gives out again!	
300625128	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Faye	1	It's so hot... You know, I didn't really mean it, so you don't have to actually bring me along...	
300625129	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (??)	1	We'll have to continue on foot from here on out. This brings back so many memories... I have a brother named Riot..	
300625130	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (??)	1	We used to come here after sparring to grab two barrels of oil for lubrication and refreshment... Something is coming—	
300625131	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Faye	1	So, how did you lose your legs?	
300625132	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (??)	1	Ow! M-my head! It hurts! Maybe it's the explosion! I can't remember anything!	
300625133	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Faye	1	You look awfully suspicious. Should we take your head off and take a look inside?	3
300625134	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (??)	1	Those Corrupted are no match for us! Still as weak as ever!	
300625135	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongjianyingNomal01.png		1	...I didn't see you hit a Corrupted once.	
300625136	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Faye	1	It isn't the time for this. The real danger is coming at us!	
300625137	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (??)	1	Let's act now!	2
300625138	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (??)	1	I feel like my head is hot enough to be used for frying an egg...	
300625139	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongjianyingNomal01.png		1	Speaking of which, I haven't had lunch yet. Hold your head still (taking out an egg from somewhere).	
300625140	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (??)	1	...Knock it off! The Corrupted didn't eat anything, either!	
300625141	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Faye	1	...I think I'm going to get overheated...	
300625142	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (??)	1	Weakling! I, King Wrench XIV, was born in fire!	
300625143	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV (??)	1	...How about I go find a Nozzle and take a cooling module out of it!	3

300625291	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RuRiTianNormal01.png	"The Sea Severer"	1	Witch? You didn't see her on your way here? But she's even more—I'm not finished yet!

300625297	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Faye	1	I'm sorry. My brother has just recovered from an illness. That's why he's way too enthusiastic than usual.	
300625298	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV	1	You should rest up. It's been an exhausting day for you, right? (thump)

300625300	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	"God of River"	1	I have a golden wrench, silver wrench, and... a wrench that fell from the sky! Which one is yours?	
300625301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV	1	All of them are—Cut out the tricks! Hand it back to me now, or I'll make you regret it.

300625315	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV	1	And don't get too aggressive if the guards don't recognize me!

300625341	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongjianyingNomal01.png	Former Captain "Tian the Wicked"	1	H-he's already hung up his spurs! What about I give you three bows as a token of my apology?	
300625342	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV	1	So many things have changed... Well, it can't be helped.	
300625343	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV	1	Behind this courtyard is where Yazi lives, but it's guarded by the elite members she chose from the Twelve Palaces. We must be careful with every step!	
300625344	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	?	1	We've been waiting for you! Now embrace your death, thieves!	
300625345	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongjianyingNomal01.png	"Twelve Palaces"	1	For Yazi! For... love and justice!	3

300625348	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongjianyingNomal01.png		1	Speaking of which, why do the Twelve Palaces have so many members?

300625350	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV	1	No need to het heated. If Yazi isn't around, we're happy to wait inside until she's back!

300625353	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV	1	This could've been avoided. If Yazi's back, tell her we came!

300625370	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi	1	...Looks like you're really him. Well then, let's talk about the mess in my house, shall we? (No one dares make a single sound.)	
300625371	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi	1	It'd be impossible not to notice something as big as Riot. I had my men retrieve him once I received a report that an accident had happened in the forest.	
300625372	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi	1	But Wrench's whereabouts still remained a mystery, and two years passed... Worry? Hum, it's Wrench we're talking about.	
300625373	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi	1	As for the weird girl you brought up, I'm clueless as well. The rumors are already untraceable, but to have this under my nose...

300625380	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi	1	Anyway, that's it. I apologize for my men's rudeness once again.	
300625381	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi	1	And thank you for taking care of Wrench. Without your help, he wouldn't have made it this far.	
300625382	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi	1	But I can't let a hotheaded guy like him continue to stay by your side and put you in danger. That's why your journey with him has to end here.

1017011210	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	???	1	Hello, can you hear me? I forgot to mention something.	
1017011211	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	???	1	Hoper carries a repulsion shield recently developed to deal with the flying enemies.	
1017011212	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	???	1	But Hoper is not capable of keeping it running for a long time, so you have to stay connected to keep it running.	
1017011213	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Captain Olke	1	Understood. And you are...?	
1017011214	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Keena	1	I'm Keena. I used to work on the maintenance of Hoper. We will see each other again if you can come back alive.	
1017011215	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Captain Olke	1	... Is she a technician with Kurono?	
1017011216	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Keena	1	I've never seen someone being so picky while using my stuff. How adorable!	
1017011217	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Keena	1	Alright. Just remember to stay connected with Hoper to keep the shield powered.	
1017011218	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Keena	1	The shield will help you defend against the enemies. It features an identification friend or foe system that will detect the enemies and clear them out of itself.	
1017011219	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Keena	1	Now Liv is in Hoper. Please turn on the shield and activate power connection channel.	
1017011220	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Roger.	
1017011221	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Captain Olke	1	Turning on the shield. Confirm.	
1017011222	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Captain Olke	1	Activating the channel. Confirm.

1017011225	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Captain Olke	1	We will take care of the escort mission. You are a support Construct. Stay in "Hoper" to scout enemies for us.	
1017011226	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Understood! I'll share the detection signals to everyone to adjust the formation accordingly.	
1017011227	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Captain Olke	1	The Red Orb signifies attack formations. The Blue Orb signifies defense formations. The Yellow Orb signifies speed formations.	
1017011228	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Captain Olke	1	All out!	
1017011231	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	All enemy signals are away... We are safe now.	
1017011232	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But Hoper is out of power, and we've got casualties as well...	
1017011233	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's not the time to give up...	
1017011234	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We have to transport those who are still alive back to Babylonia...!	
1017011236	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Percy	1	All enemy signals are away... We are safe now.	
1017011237	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Percy	1	But Hoper is almost out of power, and we've got casualties as well...

1017011401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	It's almost the time to meet up with the other guys.	
1017011402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	Wait. The Corrupted nearby are coming over.	
1017011403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	Looks like they are controlled by someone.	
1017011404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Is it because the twins are also approaching?	
1017011405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	That voice is...!	
1017011406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	Watch out!	
1017011407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Hurry! The entrance is over there!	4
1017011408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Looks like there was a fight...	
1017011409	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	The Corrupted and Hetero-Creatures are everywhere.	
1017011410	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	No one can survive this.	
1017011411	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Proceed to the entrance.	
1017011412	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Destroy all the Corrupted.	
1017011413	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Proceed to the station platform.	
1017011501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct A	1	Gray Raven and Strike Hawk...!	
1017011502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We are here to help you.	
1017011503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct B	1	Careful! They came out of nowhere and attacked out teammates.	
1017011504	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct B	1	But they disappeared when we attempted to strike back.	
1017011505	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	Keep your guard up... We'll go check the side of the train.	
1017011506	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct A	1	These are the monsters we've seen before.	
1017011507	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The Hetero-Sapiens! They are trying to get on the train!	
1017011508	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Let me shoot them off with my bullets in advance.	
1017011509	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	They are on the train! Keep blocking them! Don't let them get here!	3
1017011510	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	They appeared again! Hurry! Shoot them off!	
1017011511	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct B	1	There seems to be enemies on the other side of the train!	
1017011512	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Understood!	
1017011513	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct A	1	The twins are approaching fast! At the end of the train!	
1017011514	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Don't let them get on the train! We have to stop them before that happens!	
1017011515	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct A	1	They're here again!	2
1017011516	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Watch out!	2
1017011601	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct A	1	Asslam...! We finally made it.	
1017011602	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct A	1	I'll leave the Omega II Prototype here. I guess you're gonna need it.	
1017011603	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	That's right. We have to turn it on to attract them.	
1017011604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	And to buy some time for the crowd to retreat.	
1017011605	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	We must get the wounded to the train for treatment.	
1017011606	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Alright.	
1017011607	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Prepare to activate the Omega II Prototype here, Lee.	
1017011608	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Leave it to me.	
1017011610	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Leave it to me. You go deal with the enemies. Don't let them get here.	4
1017011611	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Activated. Now it shouldn't be a problem to kill these Hetero-Creatures.	4
1017011612	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	This one looks different from what we've seen before.	
1017011613	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Enter Matrix. That's the only way to kill it.	
1017011614	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	They were already attracted.	
1017011615	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	The twins are coming over. Prepare for retreat.	
1017011616	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	There are too many enemies... Eliminate them asap!	4
1017011617	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lee, how is it going? More and more Hetero-Creatures are coming over...	
1017011618	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	I need to focus.	3
1018010211	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Snipey! It's a swing! Nanami can swing 2,000 swings per minute!	
1018010212	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	That's awesome...	
1018010213	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Right? Nanami is awesome!	
1018010214	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	No, I meant that swing.	
1018010221	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Mr. Zombie slide. It's inspired by the most popular anime character ever. Have you seen it, Snipey?	
1018010222	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	No. It will only waste my storage space.	
1018010223	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	That's not good. How would you make friends at school if you don't watch the most popular anime?	
1018010224	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	I don't go to school, so I don't need any friends there.	
1018010231	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	This is the octopus slide. And we can also play hide and see around it.	
1018010232	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	It's a nice place to hide. You won't be found if you hide in the middle.	
1018010233	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Even if they find you, you can immediately run away in any direction.	
1018010234	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	That's what I'm saying, Snipey!	
1018010241	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	The pumpkin baron! My favorite! And it's doll.	
1018010242	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	It can shoot its pumpkin head at the bade guy!	
1018010243	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Seems it's just an auto sniper platform just like me except that I shoot bullets.	
1018010244	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	How I wish I could fire laser beams from my head...! NANAMI—BEEEEEEEAM!	
1018010251	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	This is a tramway above ground, plus many skyscrapers.	
1018010252	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	This place must have been filled with commuters...	
1018010253	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Meaningless travel will only expose yourself. I'd rather stay put unless it's necessary.	
1018010254	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Then I guess you're a... homebody then.	
1018010261	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	This is the way to the recharge station. All these machines are energy-driven.	
1018010262	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	The pursuit of endless energy makes humanity to research the Zero-point Energy.	
1018010263	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	The same goes with machines.	
1018010271	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	The rest area is ahead of us in this way.	
1018010272	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Are you tired?	
1018010273	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	No. But sometimes it's not only the body that needs rest.	
1018010274	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	But I think I'm more mentally tired than you.	
1018010275	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Then, how about...	
1018010276	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	I'm good. Thank you.	
1018010281	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Snipey! It's a bus!	
1018010282	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Why yelling? It's just a common vehicle.	
1018010283	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	The bus equals to travel! Travel with friends! Isn't it exciting?	
1018010291	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	The track extends into the distance... What do you say the tram goes to, Snipey?	
1018010292	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Could it be somewhere less cold?	
1018010293	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Impossible. The entire Earth has already fallen into the Ever-Winter.	
1018010294	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	What a shame...	
1018010301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	It's cold! Snipey, I'm gonna catch a cold.	
1018010302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Machines do not "catch a cold," but the coldness will freeze their buffer fluid and slow down their movement...	
1018010303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Do not stand still! Eliminate the Corrupted immediately... What are you doing?	
1018010304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	One, two! One, two! Nanami is warming up, but I don't think I've seen any Corrupted...	
1018010305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Maybe it is not just us... Perhaps the Corrupted are also frozen in the cold weather.	
1018010311	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Look, Snipey! There's a little bird! It's frozen! Poor bird!	
1018010312	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	It does not look like a "little" bird to me...	
1018010313	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Hey, do not approach it. I detected high Punishing Virus concentration. It is a Corrupted!	
1018010314	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Huh?! Then we have to take it down! Snipey, Power, let's go!	
1018010321	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	There is a human ahead! Looks like that person is waving to us!	
1018010322	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	It is impossible for humans to survive this cold weather with so few clothes on.	
1018010323	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Hello, how are you? Let's go have a look, Snipey!	
1018010324	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	I genuinely suspect that there is something wrong with your auditory system. Get it fixed.	
1018010331	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Haha! It's Nanami and Commandant's snowman!	
1018010332	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	The snowman would be buried in the snow in no time in the snowstorm. What you are doing is meaningless.	
1018010333	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	It's a short "moment" for us, but it might be a long "eternity" for the snowman.	
1018010334	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Hmm... Something is missing here...

1020010242	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BiankaNormal01.png	Bianca	1	It was sealed from the other side.

1020010361	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Member A	1	It came before we noticed but didn't attack us. The behavioral patterns of the Hetero-Creatures is getting weird.	
1020010362	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Member C	1	But thanks to this, we can take care of it with just one shot.

1020010290	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BiankaNormal01.png	Bianca	1	We will get to the lower third floor as long as we pass through here.

1020010412	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BiankaNormal01.png	Bianca	1	I have to get out of here before it's too late.

1020010418	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BiankaNormal01.png	Bianca	1	Are they talking about the same place? The Phantom Tracer seems to be absorbing something.	3
1020010419	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BiankaNormal01.png	Bianca	1	It stopped. It seems I can restart it again.	3

1020010506	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BiankaNormal03.png	Bianca	1	Don't be afraid. I'll save you.

1020010510	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BiankaNormal01.png	Bianca	1	Time to meet up with the others.	
1020010511	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BiankaNormal01.png	Bianca	1	Hmm...	
1020010512	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BiankaNormal01.png	Bianca	1	The Phantom Tracer is... going backward.

1020010532	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BiankaNormal01.png	Bianca	1	He was looking at someone standing in my direction.

1020010540	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Tip	1	This stage is an extension of the main story and takes longer time to complete. Please make sure you have enough time.	
1021010601	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Asimov	1	Simulation system loaded... How do you feel? Anything strange?	
1021010602	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	Not at all. Everything is good. The adaptation is better than I expected.	
1021010603	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Asimov	1	Good. Seems the M.I.N.D. and frame are going well together.	
1021010604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Asimov	1	Let's start the first test then. Use the basic abilities of your frame to defeat the enemy.	
1021010605	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Asimov	1	The mobility of this frame has been significantly improved based on your habits and requirements. It also comes with excellent firepower.	
1021010606	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Asimov	1	However, that will also increase your burden in combat. When facing a large number of enemies, you'll need to make use of all available weapons to quickly finish them off.	
1021010607	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Asimov	1	I'll give you plenty of Signal Orbs in the second test. Use your Composite Armaments to deal with the vast number of enemies.	
1021010608	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	Okay. I think I've pretty much mastered this frame.	
1021010609	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Asimov	1	The basic abilities are enough for you to handle regular combat. But on top of that, we still plan to add a special power to this frame.	
1021010610	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	Plan to...?	
1021010611	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Asimov	1	Right. For now, this feature only exists in theory...	
1021010612	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Asimov	1	With its incredible instant computing power, when this frame is running at maximum output, it can even "transcend beyond time and dimensions."	
1021010613	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Asimov	1	Let's just call it "Hypermatrix" for now. You can try using this feature in the simulated battle first.	
1021010614	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	I'm ready.	
1021010615	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	Is this the Hypermatrix you mentioned?	
1021010616	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Asimov	1	Just like Matrix, it will forecast all possible enemy actions. They must be near stationary in your eyes.	
1021010617	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Asimov	1	But Hypermatrix is more than that.

1021010622	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Asimov	1	Great. You can consume the skill data to generate new "Sight Points", and unleash them all onto the enemy when Hypermatrix ends.	
1021010623	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Asimov	1	When Hypermatrix is closed, all the "Sight Points" across all the dimensions will be unleashed onto the enemy.

1021010625	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Asimov	1	From now on, I'm going to load the data of some formidable enemies.	
1021010626	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Asimov	1	The system will no longer help you maintain Hypermatrix. You'll need to control it yourself.	
1021010627	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	I see.	
1021010628	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Asimov	1	Let's call it a day.	
1021010629	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Asimov	1	Your computing power is all drained... Let's call it a day before you put yourself in danger.	
1021010630	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	Alright. I think we just need a few more tweaks before officially deploying the frame in combat.

1021011208	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	I need to go to the surface. There's an urgent mission.

1021011223	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132gztNormal01.png	Crowe	1	The HQ just ordered all normal Constructs to be on standby for combat. There shouldn't be any urgent mission.	
1021011224	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	I'm as normal as can be, but I don't have time to explain my mission in more detail.

1021011227	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132gztNormal01.png	Crowe	1	The only possible way is to jump down from Dominik Memorial Park.	
1021011228	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132gztNormal01.png	Crowe	1	According to the map, you can enter the hangar from there. You should be able to find some transport crafts with sufficient energy left.

1021011238	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	The gravity system was shut down? What happened in the control center...?

1021011242	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132gztNormal01.png	Crowe	1	I'm not even surprised. But there are just too many of them...	
1021011243	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132gztNormal01.png	Crowe	1	As I keep the gravity field activated, I won't be able to deal with them.	
1021011244	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	Leave them to me. We must get rid of them as soon as possible.

1021011249	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132gztNormal01.png	Crowe	1	I've no idea. Maybe he hung up, or something else happened. I could only hear noises.	
1021011250	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132gztNormal01.png	Crowe	1	This is weird... Is there any interference?	
1021011251	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132gztNormal01.png	Crowe	1	The Constructs here are also contaminated by the Mind Beacon... Argh...

1021011253	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132gztNormal01.png	Crowe	1	Lack of hibernation, I guess. The mission takes priority. Let's keep moving...

1502040333	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Cerberus' commandant has absolute trust in me and will never treat me like a monitored subject. What do you say, dollface?	
1502040334	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	I'd rather say Cerberus' commandant is also struggling to discipline a vicious dog. We should exchange thoughts on this.	
1502040335	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Oh, unfortunately, my commandant has many more important jobs to do than listening to your constructive insights.	
1502040336	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	I don't think the things between higher-ups are for you to worry about.	
1502040337	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	Toys should only do what toys are supposed to do. Now move in the 30-degree direction!	
1502040338	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1.png	Bambinata	1	Yes, Mistress.	
1502040339	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Hmph.	
1502040340	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	Bambinata, check one more time if the ones on the tree are the same type of experimental Constructs that attacked us.	
1502040341	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1.png	Bambinata	1	Negative. The ones that attacked Mistress were the Corrupted.	
1502040342	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1.png	Bambinata	1	However, the remains on the tree are not simply experimental Constructs. Some of them also show faint Punishing Virus readings.	
1502040343	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	Given that our target location is about 500 meters ahead, it's possible that it's already been invaded by the Corrupted.	
1502040344	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	We'll be moving forward stealthily from here on.	
1502040801	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Hmph, a welcome party like this...	
1502040802	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Trying to stall for time?	
1502040803	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	That Construct! Don't let him run away!	
1502040804	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	I know—	
1502040806	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	...Infighting?	
1502040807	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	Shh! Don't alert them yet.	
1502040808	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	That Construct seems to be getting punished.	
1502040809	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Because he ran away?	
1502040810	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	If he retains such a strong will to survive, he may not have lost his mind completely.	
1502040811	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	What are you trying to say?	
1502040812	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	If he's still somehow sane, we can simply make him to spit out where dollface is exactly.	
1502040813	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	Your strategy's really...	
1502040814	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Let's capture him alive.	
1502040815	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	Hey, it should be the commandant to give orders!	
1502040816	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	...Can you understand my words?	
1502040817	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Excellent. I won't hurt you if you can answer a few questions.	
1502040818	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Where is the little blue-and-white-dressed doll now?	
1502040819	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Naughty	1	...Group...	
1502040820	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Naughty	1	...Game... Time...	
1502040821	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	...You've got the nerve!	
1502040822	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	Hold on, let's split up here.	
1502040823	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	You go after him. I'll head back to the security room and see if there are any more clues about those Constructs' intentions.	
1502040824	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Suit yourself, if you're so confident that you can protect yourself on your own.	
1502040825	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	Ha, keep this to yourself.	
1502040826	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	If you need help, just yell for me. I can't miss this scene.	
1502040827	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	I'll give you the last shot.	
1502040829	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Game rules? What do they have to do with my question?	
1502040830	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Too bad you've wasted your last chance.	
1502040831	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Begging for life? Or...	
1502040832	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Leading the way? I'd better follow him.	
1502040833	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	The game he mentioned before? Is it some kind of procedural behavior among those Constructs?	
1502040834	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Footsteps...	
1502040835	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Footsteps... As expected, it was stalling for time.	
1502040836	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	...Fair enough, but it's time to play my game. The ones lose the moment they get cut down—	
1502040837	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Let's have fun, shall we?	
1502040838	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Have you found any clues?	
1502040839	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	Almost all cameras were shut off.	
1502040840	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	But I managed to find a clip from about fifteen minutes ago. I'm syncing it to your terminal now.	
1502040841	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	...Your face looks like you've failed the mission and our transport craft was blown up.	
1502040842	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	...	
1502040843	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	What? Something even worse?	
1502040844	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	...No, I just saw something dull.	
1502040845	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	A pair of old ballet shoes... in a box?	
1502040846	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	...It's none of your business.	
1502040847	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Sync completed.	
1502040851	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	Those Constructs were heading in the same direction before they disappeared.	
1502040852	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	That's the direction toward the the end of the living room.	
1502040853	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	This is where they disappeared.	
1502040854	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	Under the carpet must be a hidden door.	
1502040855	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	I've got this.	
1502040857	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	If your blade had gone just a bit more to the right, you'd be facing a court martial afterward.	
1502040858	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Accidents won't exist if they don't happen.	
1502040859	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Let's go.	
1502040860	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	Wait, before that, we should investigate all the unchecked rooms.	
1502040861	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	It's possible that Bambinata didn't act as we deduced.	
1502040862	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	If all those Constructs were really down here like the cameras showed, they could've overwhelmed us...	
1502040863	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Vanessa	1	And our situation will be even more dire if Bambinata isn't there. Not to mention circling back to find her will require more time and effort.	
1502040864	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Vera	1	Fine, let's get going.	
13021401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	Female Captain	1	The Corrupted have appeared. Prepare to engage!	
13021402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotinvNormal01.png	Female Construct	1	Roger!	
13021403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotinvNormal01.png	Female Construct	1	The defense force has been informed! Reinforcements are on their way!	
13021404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	Female Captain	1	...	
13021405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	Female Captain	1	Are you the reinforcements? But you don't seem to be on the drill roster...	
13021406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal02.png	Nanami	1	Drill? Oh, let's pretend you were saved by a masked superhero who happened to be passing by.	
13021407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	Female Captain	1	Wait, where are you going?	
13021408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	Female Captain	1	The area over there is conducting a security drill for the Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations. I can't let you through.	
13021409	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Ehhh?!	
13021410	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Plan B, Power! Let's go the other way!	
13021411	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	...	
13021412	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	The first floor is blocked off because of the drill... But the second floor is still accessible.	
13021413	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Are you... the Tank Construct of the Support Force?	
13021414	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Um... Nanami's just passing by...	
13021415	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Whatever, it's good to have reinforcements here.	
13021416	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	The drill-specific robots over there have lost control. They need your help!	
13021417	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Just listen to Nanami!	
13021418	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotinvNormal01.png	Female Construct	1	Why are they suddenly going into a rage?!	
13021419	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotinvNormal01.png	Female Construct	1	Please go help them!	
13021420	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Seriously...	
13021421	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotinvNormal01.png	Female Construct	1	The robots are blocking the road there. No one can get through!	
13021422	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Nanami will take care of it. Nanami, Power, taking off!	
13021423	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Mission accomplished! Nanami will be returning now!	
13021424	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Oh, not returning. Nanami should head to the landing pad.	
13021425	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Excuse me, do you know how to get down to the first floor? We really need to go to the landing pad.	
13021426	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotinvNormal01.png	Female Construct	1	First floor? It's locked down now. No one can enter under normal circumstances.	
13021427	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal02.png	Nanami	1	Then Nanami has no choice but to make the circumstances abnormal...	
13021428	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal02.png	Nanami	1	Fly! Power!	
13021429	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	Female Captain	1	Waaait! W-what are you doing?	
13021430	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Nanami has to go to the first floor. There's something important at the landing pad!	
13021431	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	Female Captain	1	...	
13021432	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	Female Captain	1	The drill robots are everywhere down there! You'll get hurt going there alone!	
13021433	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	Female Captain	1	Give me a minute. I'll contact your instructor...	
13021434	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	A minute? Sorry, but every minute counts now... Power, speed max!	
13021435	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	The robots are gathering around... Alright, Nanami and Power will take you down at once!	
13021436	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	I have to watch the time, too. The drone is taking off soon.	
13021437	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Hmm... This is the only way left.	
13021438	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Direct smash!

74439401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier Jack	1	I await your order, Boss.

74439406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132snNormal01.png	Demolitionist Suma	1	Only the last one left, Boss!	
74439407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	Patrolling Refugee	1	Well done!	2
74439408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	Patrolling Refugee	1	Hooray! Blow it up!	2

210001001	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	Patrolling Refugee	1	The Corrupted's here!	3
210001002	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier Jack	1	Those monsters have come to us, Boss.	
210001003	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier Jack	1	They came earlier than expected... I knew we couldn't rely on the forecast from those nerds.	
210001004	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier Jerry	1	Some people have yet to evacuate. What do we do, Boss?	
210001005	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier Jerry	1	We should leave too!	
210001006	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	No. The target is moving way too fast. The Corrupted are going to hunt us down. We can't risk it.	
210001007	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	We hold off the Corrupted right here. Everyone else, evacuate immediately!	
210001008	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier Jack	1	Got it! At your command!	
210001041	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	Patrolling Refugee	1	Boss! The Corrupted are coming from other directions!

210001019	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Zachery was right. This is a tough opponent to deal with.	3
210001020	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	I remember the shield could be neutralized...

210001052	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132snNormal01.png	Demolitionist Suma	1	Explosives have been set up on the evacuation route. If I detonate them from underground, they should be able to break its shield!	
210001053	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Well done. Let's go with Plan B. I will guide the target to the route, and you will decide when to blow it up.	
210001054	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Its shield may regenerate multiple times. Keep monitoring!

210001029	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132snNormal01.png	Demolitionist Suma	1	The shield is gone! Attack now!	3
210001030	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	One more time and it's dead!	3

210001034	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Target is highly damaged and close to ceasing activity.	
210001035	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Seems it still has some energy left...	
210001036	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132snNormal01.png	Demolitionist Suma	1	Shall we keep attacking?	
210001037	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	No, the Corrupted's actions are out of control. There's a higher risk if we approach it.	
210001038	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Just let its energy run out. The majority of us have already evacuated to a safe area. Tell the distraction team to continue with their mission.	
210001039	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Alright, we're about to wrap up the mission. Good work, everyone! Let's evacuate.

1021011807	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	I guess it's the only option I have now.

1021021801	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	Are you ready?	
1021021802	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	Let's begin.	
1021021803	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	I found a way to the top of the tower. I'll leave the rest to you.	
1021021804	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	I'm trying to open a path to the top of the tower, but they are already here.	3
1021021805	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	Done. The path to the top is open now!	3
1021021806	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	What happened?!	3
1021021807	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	I knew it wouldn't be that easy... How's the situation over there?	
1021021808	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	So far so good. This wall should be part of the self-protection system of this tower.	
1021021809	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	Can you break it from within?	
1021021810	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	I tried. Didn't work.	
1021021811	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	Looks like I'm trapped here for now.	
1021021812	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	But if the spacetime here is all chaotic, there is no point to stall us.	
1021021813	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	Be careful. This wall isn't just here to separate us.	
1021021814	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	I'll continue looking for a solution. Don't let down your guard.

1021021816	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	Leave it to me.	3
1021021817	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	Good news. I found a vulnerability in this barrier.	
1021021818	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	If only I had enough firepower... My current weapon isn't capable of doing that much damage.	
1021021819	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	But you can.	
1021021820	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	Great. I know I'm the best.	3
1021021821	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	Let's continue onward.	
1021021822	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	...	
1021012000	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	This should be the top of the tower.	
1021012001	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	What's that device over there...	
1021012002	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	...It's the core contained within the barrier.	
1021012003	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	It's emitting strong electro-magnetic interference... Looks like this is the key to stopping the disaster.	
1021012004	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	We need to break the barrier with heavy fire.	
1021012005	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	I don't think it will be that easy, but let's give it a try anyway.	
1021012006	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	That's what I thought... The attack didn't even reach the core.	
1021012007	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	If only we could get a little closer...	
1021012008	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee?	1	Stop wasting energy. It won't work.	3
1021012009	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee?	1	The barrier is part of the tower itself.	3
1021012010	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee?	1	To deactivate it, we need to find the energy cores that are hidden in different locations.	3
1021012011	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee?	1	But before that... Let's deal with them first.	3
1021012012	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	No more signs of Hetero-Creature activities.	3
1021012013	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	He... I mean, the other me, might have progressed further than I have.	
1021012014	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	But we still failed to find the solution...	
1021012015	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee?	1	I'll keep this short. I've been here before, but could not break through this barrier.	
1021012016	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee?	1	I hate to admit this, but my frame is at its limit.	
1021012017	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee?	1	But your frame... I have never seen it before.	
1021012018	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee?	1	Maybe this can be our chance.	
1021012019	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	What's this vibration...	3
1021012020	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee?	1	Quick! Brace yourself for impact!	3
1021012021	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee?	1	I failed again... Dammit!	3
1021012022	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee?	1	(Tries to stand up)	
1021012023	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee?	1	This isn't the first time...	
1021012024	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	(Takes a deep breath)	
1021012025	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	We are missing some key information... Wait, could it be...?	
1021012026	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee?	1	We have to try something else.	3
1021012027	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee?	1	It's okay. As long as we are still here, we have endless chances to keep trying.	3
1021012028	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	We will open the paths to other key locations for you.	3
1021012029	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	You must find the answer yourself.	3

1021022000	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	Is this the core supplying energy to the barrier?	
1021022001	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	Shall I break it? Or...	
1021022002	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	I knew it... Part of this energy can be extracted.

1021011929	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal02.png	Lost Child	1	But where did he go...?	
1021011930	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It has a hollow base. I should probably flip it.

1021011944	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	This area is getting unstable.	3
1021011945	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	Message delivered. There's nothing I can do here.	
1021011946	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	Better leave before I interfere with this world's original track.	
1021011947	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I did some quick treatments. Still, I suggest you let a doctor look at your wounds ASAP.	
1021011948	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	Injured Young Man	1	No worries. Thanks, Lee. I'm just a little curious... How did you find me?	
1021011949	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I was tracking the signal launcher in the phonograph's base. But I didn't know it was you.	
1021011950	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	Injured Young Man	1	Phonograph? Launcher? What are you talking about...?

1021011952	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	Injured Young Man	1	Sorry for being late. I had a little accident...

1021011955	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal02.png	Lost Child	1	Brother... You have so many wounds...	
1021011956	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	Injured Young Man	1	Don't worry. They don't hurt anymore.	
1021011957	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal02.png	Lost Child	1	You're lying! They must hurt a lot. I'll help you change the dressing when we get home.	
1021011958	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal02.png	Lost Child	1	I can take care of you too, Brother. I'm not a child anymore.

1021011960	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	Injured Young Man	1	Alright, we'll see you then, Lee.	
1021011961	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	Injured Young Man	1	Oh, did you see my phonograph? I forgot where I put it...	3
1021011962	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal02.png	Lost Child	1	Phonograph? Yeah. It was with the music bot.	3
1021011963	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	Injured Young Man	1	Music bot? How weird. How did it end up there?	
1021011964	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal02.png	Lost Child	1	The bot probably found it somewhere and picked it up...	
1021011965	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	They remind me of the days with Murray...	3
1021011966	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	"Family is irreplaceable..."	3
1021011967	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I've been caught up in all the missions and haven't talked with Murray much recently.	3
1021011968	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Murray? Yeah, I'm still on the surface...	
1021011969	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal02.png	Lost Child	1	This is Brother's phonograph!	3
1021012100	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	This abnormal space... Feels like a mixture of many different M.I.N.D.s of unknown origins.	
1021012101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	I must break through this barrier when the space is still stable.	
1021012102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	These barriers look a little similar to the one inside the tower.	
1021012103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	If they are based on the same theory, maybe I can...	
1021012104	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	I knew it wouldn't be that easy.	3
1021012105	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	What if I try to reverse the "time" of this barrier?	3
1021012106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	Right here... I just need to adjust the power output...	
1021012107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	That's what I thought...	
1021012108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	It's a memory fragment, but some of its content is missing.	
1021012109	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	Another memory fragment. It seems to be linked to the last one.	
1021012110	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	Another memory fragment. I cannot seem to recognize its content.	
1021012111	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	The memory fragments have formed a new piece of data. Would it be related to the "whirlpool" over there?	3
1021012112	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Lee	1	Let me see what secret lies behind it...	
1021012113	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Dammit. Where am I now?	
1021012114	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	What are those things ahead...?	
1021012115	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Is this... my frame? No. Something isn't right...	
1021012116	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Looks like the frame was killed by someone.	
1021012117	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I don't have any memories about it.	
1021012118	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Another frame of "me."	
1021012119	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	What's with that posture? What went down?	
1021012120	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Why do I suddenly think of Murray...?	
1021012121	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I see... These are all different projections of "me" at different times.	
1021012122	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	All of them... faced an inevitable death in the end.	
1021012123	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Who would go out of their way to put this here? What a weirdo.	
1021012124	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	If all of their destinies were pre-determined, does the ending I'm trying to find really exist?	3
1021012125	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Another projection... But it can move by itself?	3
1021012126	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Do I still have to fight here...?	3
1021012127	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	No. This isn't an enemy...	3
1021012128	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It feels a little strange. It shouldn't be like this.	3
1021012129	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I see... This is "myself" too.	
1021012130	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Exactly like the projection earlier.	
1021012131	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	So it was me...	
1021012132	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Why are there Hetero-Creatures here?	3
1021012133	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I have no time to waste. I must find a node that takes me back to the tower ASAP.	3
1021012134	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Over there!	
1021012135	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Done.	
1021012136	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I wonder what is happening to the rest of "me"...	
1021012137	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This M.I.N.D. is getting unstable. If they are also here...	
1021012138	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	What's this vibration...	3
1021012139	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	No...!	3
1021012140	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Another chaotic space... I need to get out of here quickly.	3
1021012141	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	What's this?!	3
1021012142	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	It's a familiar voice. Who can it be...?	3
1021012143	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Do you have a message for me? From myself in the past...	
1021012144	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	No... It's probably me from another "world."	
1021012145	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	...	
1021012146	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	We have always been looking for the "right path," and eliminating every me that has gone on a wrong way.	
1021012147	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	The legacy we have left is enough to change a lot of things, isn't it?	3
1021012148	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Tell me the answer you have seen.	3
1021012149	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	At the root of all the disasters, who is stopping us from reaching the future?	3
1021012150	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	...	
1021012151	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Different enemies, different disasters and endings, bringing similar tragedies.	
1021012152	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	No matter how many times I must do this, I will not hesitate to point my gun at anyone who stands in my way!	
1021012153	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	How annoying. Let's finish them off first.	3
1021012154	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	We have been through numerous "possibilities."	
1021012155	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	Just to find the path that can lead us to the future.	
1021012156	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee?	1	Changing everything, then repeating over and over again...

1022011702	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadHakama1.png	Haicma	1	...Allow us to bid farewell here. Spooner and I have something else to do.	
1022011703	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	I see. You take care too!

1022011103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadHakama1.png	Haicma	1	The priority now is to rescue our kin.	
1022011104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadHakama1.png	Haicma	1	We need to finish everything before their invasion is complete.	
1022011105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadHakama1.png	Haicma	1	They are hacking into the museum's security system. This is in line with our information.

1022011108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200sbnNormal01.png	Spooner	1	Phew... Is there something we can use on him?	
1022011109	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadHakama1.png	Haicma	1	If the reinforcements were summoned by them, we should be able to find some ID cards...

1022011116	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadHakama1.png	Haicma	1	Hostile targets eliminated. We should be able to find some useful information from them.

1022011150	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadHakama1.png	Haicma	1	From what we know, there is an entire squad inside trying to hack into the system. If we confront them directly, they may summon more reinforcements.	
1022011151	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadHakama1.png	Haicma	1	This control platform is also connected to the power source of the hall. We can use it to block Kurono's signals.	
1022011152	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadHakama1.png	Haicma	1	Perhaps we can control their hacking device remotely to unleash a pulse, but one of us must operate the device continuously. There is also a risk of failure.	
1022011153	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200sbnNormal01.png	Spooner	1	No problem. I'll stay here to use the remote while you wait for me in the hall. But you'll need to face them alone if my hacking fails.

1022011159	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadHakama1.png	Haicma	1	That's all I can find. How are the mechanoids, Spooner?	
1022011160	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200sbnNormal01.png	Spooner	1	The level of virus contamination is not too high. I have injected a cleansing program, and they should be fine after a while.

1022011402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	These light dots... Are they fireflies?	
1022011403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	Is this your first time seeing them, Sica? I heard that fireflies usually lived near clean water. Perhaps that's why the ground here looks like the surface of water.	
1022011404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200tlyNormal01.png	Trojan	1	Is this a... plant seed? Why is it here?	
1022011405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	This tree seems like the core exhibit.	
1022011406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	Lena	1	It doesn't look like any species in the world. Is this some sort of embellishment?	
1022011407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	A power outage? No... The other facilities are still running normally.	
1022011408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Seems like this is also part of the designed content. I have a bad feeling about it.	
1022011409	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	Is this how Punishing Hetero-Creatures are hatched...?	
1022011410	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Does Cervantes know the whole story of the Pulia Forest Park incident?	
1022011411	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	Is it mimicking some flower, or grass? Or both?	
1022011412	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	？？？	1	The direction of their evolution may not be necessarily right, but they have enough samples for reference.	4
1022011413	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	It's showing us the evolution of Hetero-Creatures.

1022011415	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	As I thought, this is a demonstration of how Hetero-Creatures have evolved. Which means the next will be...

1022011428	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	Better stick to the plan...	
1022011429	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	These light dots... Are they fireflies?	
1022011430	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	Is this your first time seeing them, Sica? I heard fireflies usually lived near clean water...

1022021403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	Lena	1	The peaceful scene was but an illusion. This is where the real challenge starts.	
1022021404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	This is the beginning of the Battle of Pulia Forest Park...	
1022021405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	...Sica, there's something that only you can do now.	
1022021406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Only I can do?	
1022021407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Alright... I'll analyze the landscape first.	
1022021408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	Here's a good spot for observation! I'll leave the rest to you, Sica.	
1022021409	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	Lena	1	I hope you weren't bragging.

1022021412	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	There aren't many things that can be used as cover here...	
1022021413	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200tlyNormal01.png	Trojan	1	That means the enemies won't come this way, right?	
1022021414	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	No, Hetero-Creatures only act on instinct. Which means...	
1022021415	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	The battle will likely take place here.	
1022021416	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Maybe we can take advantage of the height difference...	
1022021417	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	I know this tactic. Take the high ground!	
1022021418	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Um... That's one way to fight, but if we set up a feint attack to lure the enemy here...	
1022021419	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Maybe we can establish an even greater advantage.	
1022021420	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	That's enough information. I'm creating a tactic model now.	
1022021421	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	To protect our flanks, we must split into two groups... But if that's the case...	
1022021422	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	No need to worry too much, Sica. Just pick the plan that you think is the best. Leave the rest to us!	
1022021423	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200tlyNormal01.png	Trojan	1	I hate trouble...	
1022021424	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Okay, got it. We need to secure both the left and right flanks, so we can help each other.	
1022021425	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Considering the right side would be facing a greater pressure, we should allocate our forces like this...	
1022021426	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Alternatively, we can set up an ambush at the central highland. But this is somehow passive...	
1022021427	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	I like it when everybody stays together to overcome the obstacle!

1022021430	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Let's split up just to be safe.	
1022021431	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Jacqued	1	Check your equipment. Get in position!

1022021436	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Jacqued	1	Get yourself ready. According to the recon team, the Punishing creatures may come from any direction.	
1022021437	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	The position I need to take is...	
1022021438	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Wait a sec, Ayla. Something isn't right over there.	
1022021439	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Not good... Constructs may not be able to exploit this position, but Hetero-Creatures can easily break through from here!

1022021441	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Because... I ran many simulations in the past, and some of them are quite similar to this one...	4

1022021443	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Just as I thought, if enemies ever show up here, we will be caught in a dangerously passive situation.	
1022021444	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	Wouldn't that be a big problem to us?	
1022021445	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	There's a risk that we will face enemies from three directions.	
1022021446	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	...	
1022021447	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	We should gather our forces in a favorable position and wait for the enemies to come to us.	
1022021448	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Let's split into 3 groups!

1022021450	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Trojan, please defend the left flank with Captain Jacqued because you will be facing the most enemies. Ayla, I need you to be ready to support them.	
1022021451	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	"Yes, commander!"	
1022021452	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	The left flank will face many times the risk.	
1022021453	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	If the left is breached, the right side will be completely exposed.	
1022021454	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	That leaves us no time to help each other or retreat.	
1022021455	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	The risk of total failure is too high.	
1022021456	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200tlyNormal01.png	Trojan	1	The enemies can literally come out from anywhere.	
1022021457	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	A failure on paper is not a real one. Let's rethink our strategy!	
1022021458	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	That's it!

1022031410	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	I see. He wants us to experience this battle in their perspective.	
1022031411	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	Lena	1	If all goes according to the real event in history... Does Cervantes want us to "die" once?

1022031416	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	Lena	1	They were staying behind to ensure Gray Raven could deliver the sample. Even without the incident, it was hardly possible for them to return unscathed.	4

1022031427	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Ayla, Trojan, Lena... I want to do what I can.	
1022031428	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Tips	1	Start the simulation?	
1022031429	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	...I need to collect more information.	
1022031430	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	The objective is to cover those Constructs as they evacuate!	
1022031431	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	We need to stall the enemies as much as possible.	
1022031432	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	Lena	1	It's easy to say that... But no matter what plan you can come up with, we can't change what had already happened.	
1022031433	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	The majority of the enemies come from the Central Purification Filter.	3
1022031434	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	With the ruins nearby, we can set up a temporary defense point here.	3
1022031435	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	We can deploy our forces here and take advantage of the covers to hold the enemies off.	3
1022031436	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	Lena	1	We are almost out of ammunition. Even if we gather all our forces here, it won't work.	
1022031437	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	C'mon Lena. Miracles won't happen if you give up before you start!	
1022031438	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	No, there's another way!	
1022031439	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	The strength of Hetero-Creatures lies in their numbers. If we can cut them off in the middle and send some people this way...	
1022031440	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Trojan is great at assault, so she can lead this team while Lena snipes from behind.	
1022031441	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	If the frontline forces can work with us, the Hetero-Creatures won't be able to focus on both ends. This should buy us some more time.	
1022031442	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	Lena	1	Wait... Maybe it actually will work?	
1022031443	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	The rest of the battle is straight forward. Let's go, Iris Warbler.	
1022031444	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	Let's explain to Captain Jacqued.	
1022031445	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	I think we should send a team to flank the enemy from behind.	
1022031446	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Jacqued	1	Very bold idea... But it may work. I'll send someone to help you, so go for it.	
1022031447	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200tlyNormal01.png	Trojan	1	Lena, you ready? Be careful not to shoot me.	
1022031448	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	Lena	1	You better be careful not to let any Hetero-Creature through.	
1022031449	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Ayla, I need you to defend this position... I'll stay with you too. Will this really work?	
1022031450	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	Their destiny may already be determined, but Iris Warbler never gives up!	
1022031451	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Over there.	3
1022031452	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Jacqued	1	The frontline troops have engaged the enemies!	3
1022031453	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Jacqued	1	Hold your ground until the main force has evacuated!	3
1022031454	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Ayla	1	We await your order, Sica.	
1022031455	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	Lena	1	The decision is yours to make.	
1022031456	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200tlyNormal01.png	Trojan	1	I'm counting on you, so better do a good job.	
1022031457	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	Attack! Now!	3
1022031458	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Jacqued	1	Move the injured from position 1 to position 2. Where's the assault team?	3
1022031459	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Jacqued	1	Enter the position! Hurry!	3
1022031460	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Jacqued	1	Great job, assault team! Now focus fire on these Hetero-Creatures.	3
1022031461	0			3				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Charles	1	...Holding position! I can still fight!	5
1022031462	0			3				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Morris	1	Almost there. Just a little longer, and we can go...	5
1022031463	0			3				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal04.png	Garcia	1	I must survive. We are all going to survive this...	5
1022031464	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Jacqued	1	Babylonia, do you copy? I am the last survivor on my team. We have stalled the enemy for 1246 seconds...	
1022031465	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Jacqued	1	We won't be able to provide any further cover for the evacuation. Please launch the Longinus Arsenal immediately...	
1022031466	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Jacqued	1	I repeat, launch the Longinus Arsenal immediately...

1022041401	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Tips	1	Reading memories...	
1022041402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200tlyNormal01.png	Trojan	1	Did we really "die" just now? I hate to go through it again.	
1022041403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	I still couldn't change it in the end...	
1022041404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	Lena	1	It's foolish to try to change what had already happened. Well, I guess I don't get to say that, since I agreed to your plan in the first place.	
1022041405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Sica	1	What do they mean by Longinus Arsenal? No way... The strike came after all forces were fully evacuated!	
1022041406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	Lena	1	Still so naive, huh?	
1022041407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	Lena	1	Don't forget that they already lost contact with the HQ. It wouldn't take much effort to log them as killed in action.

1022041409	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Joyce	1	We detected a large number of Hetero-Creatures nearby again. You there, come help us!	3
1022041410	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Joyce	1	My infection level is already high. I'll bait them.

1022041412	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Joyce	1	Are you also survivors of the evacuation battle?	
1022041413	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Joyce	1	Our position was overrun by Hetero-Creatures. We lost contact with the main forces.	
1022041414	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Joyce	1	We are still within the impact range of Longinus Arsenal. Let's get out of here first.	
1022041415	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Kirk	1	The Mother's fragment should have been already retrieved. It's Gray Raven after all.	
1022041416	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Kirk	1	Just hold on a little longer. Maybe someone will come rescue us.
