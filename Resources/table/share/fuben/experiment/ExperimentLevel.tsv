When spring arrives, she wanders along the melting river; when autumn comes, she touches the fallen petals.\nOn rainy days, the girl plays her music alone in the secluded temple, waiting for the sun to rise again.\nAccompanies by the sky and four seasons, she grasps the remaining fragments.\nNo matter how far they are apart from each other and if the world responds to her invocation, she will keep praying for the one she misses.\nThe rain gradually eases off in the sound of her flute. When dawn comes, the bell rings too.\nWhen the sky clears, flowers will bloom again.
