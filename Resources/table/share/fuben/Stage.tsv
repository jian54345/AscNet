13012912	Descent	She stands up and looks at other wounded soldiers with visible compassion. I am surprised and even begin to think that she may be a believer.

13013111	Night Boat	Hundreds of years passed in the flutter of a butterfly's wings, and I sigh when I look back at the past. Spring has just arrived today, yet the flowers will wither tomorrow.

13013113	Return of a Distant Dawn	The plum tree branches cross the moon, creating a special atmosphere. The plum blossoms shade the moonlight, leaving dot shadows in the glass.

13013114	Dream Song	It was drizzling and windy last night. I slept in but still felt drunk. I ask the maid who is rolling up the shades, yet she tells me that the flowers are still in blossom.

13013116	Song of Fragrance	The silk handkerchief is soaked by the sudden burst of tears. It's hard to resist the sadness of not being able to see him.
