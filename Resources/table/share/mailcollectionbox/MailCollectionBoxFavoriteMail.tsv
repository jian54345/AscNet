Commando! Nanami-o here:\nFirst off! H-happy... nude-new... y-yah-year! Yarrumph... Nanami went a-playing with Ka-ku-ro—yawn—K-Karen the whooole day and we pew-pewed so many fireworks! Oh! But Commandant, don't tell Celica we blew up the CIC holo-display...\nNhn... Yawn... Anyways, Nanami is getting all snoozy-doozy, so I'm doing this early and going to sleepy town... The others who stayed home all day and got no play can do the countdowns or wossname instead! Huehuehue, Nanami's New Year greeting though, wins the race! Be Nanami's good human research subject this year too, Commandant!

It's quite lively outside...\nYou must be busy responding to the New Year messages from everyone by now.\nLooking back, we went through a lot in the last year, and I've learned a lot as well.\nThinking of our times together makes me all warm inside... I'll treasure these memories forever.\nAnd thank you for telling me about past culture, Commandant. Like this New Year.\nWe can still smile and be happy like the people of the past, even in this stricken world of ours.\nIn the past, I would not have realized the importance of the minutest joys, but you and Gray Raven made me realize how priceless they are.\nI will continue fighting alongside you as a proof of my resolve.\nSo, Commandant, please lead us forward in the coming year as well.\n\n*Attached is an obviously handmade lipsticked frog plushie. A small L is sewn on its back.*

Hello? You hear me? Alright! Here it is! The fireworks I promised.\nPhew, good thing I made it. Nanami nearly messed it all up!\nSo HEY, drop a Happy New Year for me at least, yeah?!\nI gotta be the first to get presents and blessings, you got it?!\n\nOh, and this thing's for you. Don't you snitch to Celica about my fireworks, alright?! Or you're going to PAY!

Lucia didn't get the first New Year greeting in before me, did she?! Hey! Did she?!\nArrrgh, this'll have to do! HEY! LISTEN UP!\n—Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Happy New Year!\nHowzat! That's got to have beaten Lucia in terms of Happy New Years!		
105	2	2022/1/1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	2022 New Year Mail	Lee New Year Mail	Lee	Dear Commandant:\n\nAccording to "Babylonia Residential Regulations and Restrictions", the damage to public facilities and decibel levels caused by Nanami and Karenina last night has clearly exceeded the "agreeably acceptable" standard. Through computational analysis derived from witness statements and database information, there is a high possibility that, Commandant, you, will be deemed as the person in charge.\nAs such, in the following few days, Babylonia Regional Administrations has a 66.3% chance to request from you a statement of responsibility, an explanation of circumstances, and other such relevant information. I have already prepared all the possible documents you might require, and you need only sign your name on them. I should note that there is a 1.32% possibility that Babylonia might look into relevant liabilities on the matter. In the case of such a scenario arising, I have prepared a report on possible loopholes, as well as a justifiability analysis on the standards of BRRR and the relevant data to support the analysis.\nI have also repaired the destroyed CIC holo-display last night. Depending on the investigation process, you may abstain from submitting the damage report.\n...On an unrelated note, according to Nanami's testimony and the relevant files in Babylonia's database, I have learned that today is, according to the archaic cultural customs from an Eastern country with a long history and vibrant culture, what the people of that culture call "Lunar New Year".\nIn the past year, we went through countless battles and choices together. Your command decisions have brought us victory and hope.\nYour efforts were not unrecognized by us.\nWell... It all feels quite new and awkward writing it this way.\nBut anyhow, good work for the last year, Commandant.\nHappy New Year.		
106	2	2022/1/1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	2022 New Year Mail	Liv New Year Mail	Liv	Dearest Commandant:\n\nGood morning, Commandant. A new year has come.\nI hope you slept well last night.\nDid you know? There is an Eastern custom in the past known as "Bai Nian". People would gather on New Year's Eve and celebrate the coming of the New Year. They would greet and give each other their blessings, thanking them for their kindness in the last year.\nThis is our first New Year together, Commandant. Karen told me that fireworks can be used to bring good luck, but, fireworks are so transient... which is why I'd like to give you with something more long-lasting...\nI tried making a New Year present for you. It's not much, but it'll please me greatly if you like it.\nThank you for the time we spent together. I'm infinitely grateful that you became the Gray Raven Commandant—our commandant.\nPlease lead us forward in the coming year too.\nHappy New Year

108	2	2022/1/1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	2022 New Year Mail	Bianca New Year Mail	Bianca	Dear Gray Raven Commandant:\n\nI am writing with regards to the Christmas invitation from the Gray Raven squad in the recent past. I have received the invitation, but due to Purifying Force duties concerning the safety of Babylonia officials during the holidays, I could only arrange for Karenina to join you.\nKarenina has expressed that it was a joyous event, and I am sorry for being unable to make it.\nMy shift has just ended, and I hope that this message is not too late for the New Year.\nDue to the nature of the Purifying Force's work, we have always been shunned by others, be it humans or Constructs. It is better for us that way as well. This is also part of the reason why we are usually dispatched during the festivities.\nYet, after knowing more about the Gray Raven and you, I seem to be having a change of hearts on how I feel about the matter... which is a change that I do not dislike.\nTo me, praying is nothing more than a habit, but I still pray, from the bottom of my heart, for your safety in the coming days.\nIf the circumstances permit in the next year, and as an apology for my absence from the Christmas gathering, could I ask you to join me in a short vacation together?\n\nHappy New Year.		
109	2	2022/1/1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	2022 New Year Mail	Watanabe New Year Mail	Watanabe	Dear Gray Raven Commandant:\nSorry. I finally found the time to send you a mail. No, I didn't forget about the occasion. Humans might be having their festivals, that's all good and all, but the Corrupted don't get day-offs. If we don't thoroughly clean up the area around the Oasis, it might even mess with your satellites. You probably wouldn't want extra work because of some Forsaken issues too.\nOh, and please keep your squad members in check. When I heard the explosions at night, I thought the Corrupted were knocking on our door. I got my gear and everything ready, only to find your two trouble-making lasses shooting fireworks into the sky. "It looks the best at this angle!" or something, they said...\nI know you might want to spoil them a little as their commandant, but as a leading figure, you might be too lenient on them. You make a mistake, you get disciplined. That's how it should go in the army.\nBabylonia's holidays should be over soon. You must be exhausted from playing hard during the vacation, so you should just rest in the last few days to prepare for work. I'd rather not have to stand in and clean up some new mess for Babylonia once your holidays end. And on an unrelated note, Happy New Year.\n\nP.S. I've attached a red packet for Gray Raven's aid in the previous events.		
110	2	2022/1/1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	2022 New Year Mail	Alpha New Year Mail	α	*The following is a message forcibly left in Babylonia's Command System*\n\nHeard your human New Year is here, eh? There were explosions and commotion near the settlements yesterday.\nApparently some kind of celebration ritual for a coming year? Even though it isn't 1 Jan.\nReminds me though, before the Golden Age, some Easterners used a slightly different calendar, and they based their New Year on that.\n...Humans, humans. How petty.\nDon't even know why you'd celebrate peace with explosions.\nAnd.\n—Guess I'll be watching you and the Gray Ravens this year too.		
111	2	2022/1/1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	2022 New Year Mail	Hassen New Year Mail	Hassen	Happy New Year, Commandant. My sincerest thanks to you from Babylonia.\nYour contributions and growth did not go unnoticed. We could not have achieved so much without talented and hardworking individuals like you.\nPlease rest well in this period of time. I'll be looking forward to your performance in the future.\n\nI send to you my deepest regards and thanks through this mail of mine. Every line is written with my truest blessings. Thank you for your effort this year. Let's break the record and keep the torch going next year! I wish for your good health and that everything goes your way.\nP.S. This isn't an email template.		
112	2	2022/1/1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	2022 New Year Mail	Celica New Year Mail	Celica	Dear Gray Raven Commandant:\n\nHappy New Year.\nOn the very first day of the New Year, I had to overtime at the bridge after receiving warnings about explosives. But when I got there, the supposedly broken holo-display was magically fixed.\nAnyway, Babylonia suffered no actual losses, but somehow, I still had to overtime at the bridge. You can imagine how happy I was.\nThe others from Babylonia must have already given you their New Year blessings, right? Don't forget to respond to them.\nOh, but don't take President Hassen's mail too seriously. I even told him not to use early Golden Age-styled greetings and such... He's just not with the times, that old man.\nWhen you receive this mail though, your holidays should be about over. Even though the New Year holidays are all about rest and recreation, please don't forget that they are to prepare you for the coming hardships.\nSo don't forget the good times you had in the holiday, and get ready to work hard this year!\nAgain, Commandant, Happy New Year. Babylonia and the World Government are grateful for your hard work and contributions.\n\nFrom Celica at the Babylonia Bridge\nAnd all of Babylonia		
113	2	2022/1/1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	2022 New Year Mail	Sophia New Year Mail	Sophia	 Commandant, Happy New Year, Gong Xi Fa Cai...!\n\nIs that how they say it? Changyu wasn't messing with me, right?\nAnyway, Jamilah said in her letters that we should greet people important to us in the New Year. Apparently, blessings sent in this period of time are most likely to come true.\nSo, I am hoping that you, Commandant... can be healthy for the coming year.\nJamilah wrote that on her mail to me, so... I know it must be a blessing.\nWhen I asked Jamilah,   "So what happens after the year after?"  \nJamilah replied,   "Then you need only repeat your blessing."  \nSo, the next New Year, I will still be here giving your blessings.\n\nBest,\nSophia 		
114	2	2022/1/1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	2022 New Year Mail	Chrome New Year Mail	Chrome	 Dear Gray Raven's Commandant,\n\nI have received news that Kamui has spent an entire night at Gray Raven's recreation room yesterday.\nSince Kamui was on his own in the Strike Hawk base yesterday, coupled with the New Year occasion, I had presumed that he would have more fun over at Gray Raven's, which led to this oversight of mine. He must have caused immense trouble, and I would like to apologize for that.\nWe have completed many missions together with Gray Raven, but due to time constraints, I have not been able to converse with you thoroughly. I have a lot I wish to learn from you, be it squad management, or tactical commanding. So do forgive me for asking you this favor; if you were to have the time, I would like to talk with you more.\nFrom my understanding, a New Year is a potpourri of gratitude to the past, as well as expectations for the future. It is an important event, so please allow me to send you my greetings.\nStrike Hawk has been in your care for the past year. Let us look out for each other in the future as well.I will gladly be waiting for your commands, as always.\nHappy New Year.\n\nChrome 		
115	1	2023/6/15	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/ItCharBirthday01.png	Lucia Activation Date Mail 01	Dear Commandant	Lucia's Letter I	It's been a while, Commandant... I've only been on this solo mission for a month or so, but I already feel like I've left Gray Raven and you for a long time.\nThe fights on the western front have just died down, and we've kept the enemies miles away from the line of defense. My mission here is over, and I'll be back on Babylonia in a few days.\nThe wait is excruciatingly long. I have so much I want to tell you about—not just my mission report, but the sights I've seen, the thoughts I've had... and this Activation Date without you.\n...I wish I wasn't alone on this mission. Even when I could do it by myself, I still couldn't help hoping I would somehow find you all with me on the battlefield.\nI wish I could tell Liv about the new flower I found and tell Lee about the analysis results on the anomalies. More than anything, I wish... I could see you sooner...\n...\n...Truth be told... I don't completely comprehend this feeling I have. Wanting to see you isn't something I have to report or discuss with you, after all...\nI just... want to see you.\nWhen the sun rose, I would remember how you pointed at the dawning sun.\nWhen the wind blew, and my blade cut a Corrupted in half, I would remember how you stood fast and held your head up.\nWhen the storm raged, and I saw actual ravens flying in flocks...\nFor some reason, I would think about you.\nI bet it's because I haven't gone on an expedition like this for a while. But don't worry about me. I may be thinking of you, but my blade remains sharp.\nAs I said, my mission here is accomplished. I'll be back soon, Commandant.\nBefore that, please take this souvenir"" I got from this mission—call it my Activation Date wish. I wish you had something like this with you, Commandant...\nSomething that will remind you of me.	60001	
116	1	2023/6/15	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	Lucia Activation Date Mail 02	Excerpt From "Lucia's Journal"	Lucia's Letter II	It's midnight right now. I'm sitting on the edge of a crater so large that a puddle has formed at the bottom.\nOrange-brown mud scatters around it; I think this might be a grass field before. There's even a small coral-colored flower growing in the disturbed soil. I bet Liv would know what it's called if she were here.\nHow I miss my time with Gray Raven and Commandant. Even though this has only been a short mission, I feel like months have passed, and time has slowed.\nHave I been growing dependent? Is that a positive change or a negative one, Commandant?\nBeing apart from you is probably why\nI have so much I want to say. I don't even know where to start, given everything we've been through together.\nThe past I shared with everyone, the moments I spent with you... they all seem to be affecting me in my M.I.N.D. Even now, I still can't shake that blissful sensation.\nSo I decided to record my journey this way and share it with you, Commandant. Letting you see what I've seen makes me feel like you're here, and that's good enough. Does this count as a memory we share?\nTwo birds just flew past me as I was writing this. I didn't have time to catch a clear glimpse before they were already far away.\nI can see the sun rising now.		
117	1	2023/6/15	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	α Activation Date Mail 01	%^&$ [Unknown Mail] [Intercepted]	α's Letter I	▄▆▁▃▆▆▆▃—\nLong time no see. How are you doing... That's how you people write to each other, isn't it?\nI thought our paths would never cross, Babylonian commandant. We would be two comets getting further and further away after flying past each other by chance once.\nBut even then, you said that sharing whatever time we had as each other's companion was good enough, however brief it was.\nHmph. You probably didn't even think about what your words would mean to me. Still... that's for the best. Traveling is no fun with too much baggage, so... I'll be looking for you.		
118	1	2023/6/15	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/ItCharBirthday02.png	α Activation Date Mail 02	？	α's Letter II	You didn't reply to my last message. Were you busy, or did you not receive it?\nI brought you the key to the motorbike. The key is in a transport craft heading back to Babylonia, and the bike is where your last mission took you.\nWhat? Curious how I knew where your last mission was? I'll tell you when we see each other.\nDon't worry. This trip has nothing to do with where Ascendants and Babylonia stand. I just wanted to go traveling with you for a bit. Just the two of us.\nI don't feel comfortable saying too much here. Things of "unknown origins" are often easily intercepted.\nI'll wait for you here. You have one day.	60002	
119	1	2023/7/23	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/ItCharBirthday03.png	Lee Activation Date Mail 01	Tonight...	Lee's Letter I	It's been a while since we were last on a mission together. Even though we'd run into each other in the lounge, I feel like I haven't seen you for a long time, Commandant.\nThe adaptation of the specialized frame is going well. It shouldn't be long before I can go on daily operations with you again.\nI saw how damaged your pistol was last time. I happened to have some parts from my old frame, so I thought I'd make you this pistol to use for the time being. "Protector" has a shorter range, so it's for emergencies only; it also comes with a set of 8mm rounds. Still, don't forget to request a new sidearm from the supply office.\n...I'm messaging you so suddenly because I want to see you today. Are you free tonight?\nThis isn't an invitation or anything. I just thought... it'd be more interesting to spend Activation Date with you.\nI'll be at the Babylonia restaurant.\nI'll be waiting.	60003	
120	1	2023/7/23	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	Lee Activation Date Mail 02	...	Lee's Letter II	Dammit... Shouldn't have trusted anything Kamui gave me... "Alcohol-flavor electrolyte"?\nI didn't send you that invitation. Nothing happened, and I wasn't waiting for you... Never mind.\nRegardless... thank you for coming, Commandant.		
121	1	2023/7/31	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	Chrome Activation Date Mail 01	Activation Date Invitation	Chrome's Letter I	Father told me that some of his "people" want to celebrate my Activation Date. He's going to host a banquet at the family house for them.\nFrom what I understand, my specialized frame and the recent battles have made some of the rich and powerful who distanced themselves from Constructs extend an olive branch to the Task Force.\nFather was hoping I'd invite you too.\nAs a Chief and a military hero, your appearance would be incredibly convincing at an event that aims to build bridges.\nI hope you'll attend if you're willing.\nTalking to some of the higher-ups is going to benefit future operations. More importantly, I haven't talked to you unless it's related to a mission or a fight.\nWill you come?\nI've been... missing you.		
122	1	2023/7/31	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/ItCharBirthday04.png	Chrome Activation Date Mail 02	Sorry, I'll Be Late	Chrome's Letter II	Something happened to Strike Hawk during our mission, so I have to file a report before returning. I'll be about an hour later than we planned.\nIf you're already out, would you mind waiting for me at the house? The banquet is happening in the garden.\nHere is the invitation and the keys I prepared.\nI'll be there to apologize to you in person once I finish the report. Wait for me.	60004	
123	1	2023/8/10	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/ItCharBirthday06.png	Liv Activation Date Mail 01	What Do You Want For Dinner?	Liv's Letter I	Commandant, it's my Activation Date today.\nProfessor said my condition has been stable lately. It's fine if I go back to the lounge and do my own things.\nSince I've recovered, and everyone is on Babylonia without any urgent mission...\nDo you want to bring Lucia and Lee and spend some time with me?\nI'll prepare tea and cakes. I'm not sure what to make for dinner yet.\nWhat do you want for dinner, Commandant?	60006	
124	1	2023/8/10	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	Liv Activation Date Mail 02	Thank you...	Liv's Letter II	I'm really happy I could spend Activation Date with everyone.\nI didn't think you would come to help me prepare after I sent you the ingredient list accidentally.\nIf I'm being honest... I was delighted when you walked in, even though I didn't want to be a bother.\nThank you...\nBeing able to walk with you as we get the supplies and prepare the dishes for everyone together made me very happy.\nDo you know that I had a wonderful dream before I woke up?\nIn that dream, I was also walking with you like that, hand in hand...\nIt was because of that dream and the memories of Gray Raven that I could withstand the migraines and the mirages.\nRight... I didn't answer when you asked me what wish I made. The truth is... I didn't make any wishes.\nBecause my wish has already come true.		
125	1	2023/8/15	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/ItCharBirthday07.png	Pulao Activation Date Mail 01	Commandant! Happy Birthday!	Pulao's Letter I	Hello, Commandant! This is Pulao from Kowloong! Long time no see. How have you been... Ahem, that's all the pleasantries Yazi told me to say, I think? I heard that it's your birthday today, Commandant, and people have secretly prepared a celebration on the Nighter! I've planned to set up a small shop to sell the candies I practiced making in secret. That will make me a small fortune... Anyway, this is the finished product. Give it a try, Commandant! But don't lick too hard, or your tongue will stick to it like mine did...	60007	
126	1	2023/8/15	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	Pulao Activation Date Mail 02	AAAAAAAAHHH SORRY FOR THE MIX-UP	Pulao's Letter II	I'm so sorry I mixed it up...! It's actually my Activation Date today. Thanks for reminding me, Commandant. How embarrassing! So the celebration is for me? No wonder people seem to be avoiding me lately. Honestly, I don't remember much about my past, but I'm surprised you still remember, Commandant... Hehe, that does make me quite happy. Didn't you say people can make a wish on their birthday? Can I also make a wish? Even if it's a little bit greedy? Like asking you to play with me for a whole day... That's not greedy at all? What about... No! That's too embarrassing... Anyway, I'll be waiting for you on the Nighter. I'll tell you my wish then. Pinky promise!		
127	1	2023/9/27	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/ItCharBirthday08.png	Selena Activation Date Mail 01	Message From WGAA	Ayla's Letter I	Hi, Commandant! This is Ayla of the WGAA!\nEarlier, you helped me locate the signals of the "whale song". I finally finished decoding it! I wanted to send you the results right away, but I ultimately decided to wait until today.\nI guess you've figured it out already—it's Selena's Activation Date today. This was the date Selena decided to become a Construct in order to witness the "truth." I have complicated feelings about this day... but that's a topic for another time.\nWhen I went searching on the surface, I found an amber where the signal of the "whale song" originated, placed in a field in the woods. I think it was left behind by Selena.\nI want to give you the amber today. I don't know why, but I think you should keep it.\nFinally, allow me to use the end of this letter to say something I can't tell her in person this year, either:\nHappy Activation Date, Selena!	60008	
128	1	2023/9/27	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	Selena Activation Date Mail 02	Decoded "Whale Song" By Ayla	Ayla's Letter II	I know not where I am or where I will go.\nThe world cannot be measured by journeys taken. The endless view always remains on the horizon.\n—Sometimes this makes me melancholic.\nI keep going forward, and the verses slumbering within me cannot be contained:\n"Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage, blow! You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!"\nTake away the feelings that haunt me and the passion that fills my heart.\nPerhaps then I will know where to go.\n...\nI arrived somewhere new again.\nA winding stream cascaded down a green hill. The dark ravine would resound nicely with my cello.\nThe waterfall made a thrumming bass. It made me want to set up my instrument and play music.\nNo audience. No stage. No curtains. No applauds.\nI played until I was tired. The strings hummed until I was bored.\nThe birds brought me an amber in blue when I put away the cello.\nEnveloped inside the resin was a flower I had never seen.\nOnly a moment it took me to place this gem in this field, in this woods.\nThe idea came to my mind in a flash—a code unspoken but understood.\nI wonder who you will be, kindred spirit, that this stone will find?\nI hope the same beauty graces your journey... as it did mine.		
129	1	2023/10/3	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	Sophia Activation Date Mail	Invitation To The Akdilek Ball	Sophia's Letter I	Dearest Commandant, I hope this letter finds you well.\nThat might be too formal, but Jamilah said you're an important figure, Commandant, so I should do it properly. I asked Changyu to teach me how to write letters correctly.\n(Correction marks) Let's try again. Dearest Commandant, I hope this letter finds you well. Thank you for (more correction marks) your help in the past. It's been a while since what happened. The mood on Akdilek has changed a lot, and my workload as a guard has also increased...\nSorry. I don't know how to express what has happened to us in a letter.\nJamilah said we need to cheer people up. She did some maths and said it is my "Activation Date" today, and it's something to celebrate. She's given me a new coating and hoped that I would do the first dance for a ball to cheer up our unhappy guests and colleagues.\nOn behalf of Akdilek, I am writing to invite you to participate in this ball and admire the reconstruction of Asslam at our temporary base.\nIf possible, I hope you will pay attention to the exhaust recycling system section B. I'm in charge of that. There are many good designs there. It's very admirable.\nI look forward to hearing from you.\nThe address is (correction marks)		
130	1	2023/10/3	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/ItCharBirthday09.png	Sophia Activation Date Mail	Sorry, I Forgot To Tell You The Address...	Sophia's Letter II	Sorry. I sent the last letter too quickly and forgot to give you our address.\nAs an apology, please accept this maraca. Someone gifted it to me when I worked in Maintenance. I occasionally shook it after I learned how to dance. It made a good sound.\nYes, this is an apology, not a gift. I'm not charging you or trading with you. You just take it.\nIf you can keep it safe, I will pay you a maintenance fee (scratched out) I will repay you with my actions.\nIf I ever dance again, can you shake the maraca during so?\nThe people in Maintenance were very happy when they shook it. You can be happy too. I think.\n\n\nAttached please find the coordinates.\nCome please (scratched out lightly)\nPlease visit.	60009

This is the first time I talk to you this way... What's it called again? "Letter"?\nWhatever! It doesn't make any difference. Waiting for your reply is an exciting feeling, though.\nCap told me you require assistance from one person for a mission, so I immediately took the job! I'm pumped just thinking that I can fight alongside you. Pumped!\nOh, the anticipation! It doesn't matter what job it is—I always have a good time when I'm with you, Commandant!\nI'll be on my way when you receive this! Time to show you how powerful I am after I leveled up! Hehe, see you soon!		
132	1	2023/10/23	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/ItCharBirthday10.png	Kamui Activation Date Mail	I'm So Happy, Commandant!	Kamui's Letter II	A surprise for my Activation Date! That was today's "mission"?! I did guess it, a little bit, but I wasn't expecting a surprise like that!\nAnd, and, and! The gift you gave me was something I've wanted for a long time! Someone must have looked through my history. Who was it? Cap? Wanshi? Or... you, Commandant?\nI will never ever forget about today!\nBy the way, have you guys planned something for Camu too? I can't wait to see his expression! Hehe!\nRight, speaking of gifts—I have something for you too, Commandant! Although I didn't make it myself, it's a collectible I've had for a long time! Warrior's Greatsword! Isn't it cool!\nI always wanted to find a time to give it to you properly, but the timing never worked out. Well, there's no better time than giving it to you now!\nOn the battlefield, Constructs are warriors, but so are you. As we charge in, you protect us in the back as one of us. That's the thought that gives me the strength to defy the future.\nAhem... It's weird to thank you so formally, but still. Thank you, Commandant.\nNot only for the surprise today. Thank you for protecting this world. Protecting us.	60010	
133	1	2023/10/23	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	Camu Activation Date Mail	Hmm... Ahem.	Camu's Letter I	...\nI knew an event like that was your idea. Although Kamui shares an Activation Date with me, he was surprisingly unmindful about today.\nStill, I had a feeling that he was looking forward to something.\nAhem. I didn't think you'd prepare dishes for the occasion... They might look senseless, but they didn't taste too bad. Much better than what Chrome, Kamui, and Wanshi could make.\nAlso... thank you for the cake. I... don't think I've tasted the sweetness of cream in a long time.\nIt's been a while since we all gathered like that. I suppose it wasn't as annoying as I thought, gathering now and then.\nHave I become soft because of this place? Or is it something else? Somehow, I find this world not as loathsome as before...\nTch. I ordered dinner beforehand, but now that you've messed with my plan, I guess you can take the food instead. Don't thank me.		
134	1	2023/10/23	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/ItCharBirthday11.png	Camu Activation Date Mail	—Don't Eat The Takeaway!	Camu's Letter II	Hey! What are you? Stupid?! Don't just put anything in your mouth!\nYou were lucky I found out just in time! Otherwise, they'd court-martial me for attempted murder on a commandant!\nThe takeaway I gave you... Ahem—didn't you guys make food to celebrate my Activation Date? I was looking at it, and I thought, "How hard could it be?"\nWell... the fried rice I made was a little burnt, I'll admit. I was going to throw it away and just get you a takeaway, but I took the wrong box... And why would you think that burnt rice is safe to eat?\Ahem. I bet you still haven't eaten anything with everything that happened. This nightmare-spicy golden egg fried rice and cheese hotteok is from the restaurant in the commercial district. I was going to have them for dinner, so they're safe to eat.\nIs it just me, or does this Activation Date feel like a mess? Still... I guess it's only fitting that the day would be as chaotic as it was.\n...I suppose I have to "make up" for all that trouble, don't I?\nThere's a new restaurant I've been hoping to try. I thought we could give it a go together, so I've booked us a table every day next week. I'll be waiting for you there at dinnertime.\nSee you tomorrow.	60011

Luna's Letter I	▁▃████▃—\n...Alpha told me that it is my Activation Date today.\nWhich means I volunteered to forsake my human self, embracing the Ascension-Network on this day many years ago.\nMarking a special day against the current of time is but an excuse humans make for forgetting what it was like. Humans forget their births, but Constructs don't. What happened on the day they became a Construct is forever remembered.\nOn that day, I was greeted by fear, hatred, and betrayal. Then, bullets and blades. I returned the favor afterward.\nThe hate in me has faded over time. All there remains is the cold hard truth they imprinted on me and this world. I know that the path we took meant that we all have blood on our hands. The opportunity to turn back has long passed us... not that we need it anymore.\nUnlike those humans, I won't make excuses for what I've done. To me, those people are all merely specks of dust among the despicable humans.\nBut you... you're different...		
136	1	2023/10/26	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/ItCharBirthday12.png	Luna Activation Date Mail	Maybe...	Luna's Letter II	Alpha said I should perhaps talk to you before we go.\nWe haven't seen each other after City 075, have we, Gray Raven Commandant?\nAlpha thinks I've become calmer after I left the Moon. Maybe that's because the Ascension-Network has changed. Apart from my wish and my voice, I hear another voice that acknowledges the paradise where I can live with my sister... while also acknowledging the future of humankind.\nThere should be someone like you on the path to the future—someone who is foolish enough to connect with an Ascendant.\nHa. You wouldn't give in even if it cost your life. What a fool.But I suppose that's only human, isn't it?\nYou've demonstrated what it means to be human, so don't lose your life before we create this planet anew, okay?\n...\nI brought this with me when I returned to the surface from the Moon. Alpha already took a few pieces. You can have this one.\nBy the way, you haven't been on the Moon yourself, have you?\nThe Earth surely looks different from there.\nThere was no human speaking, no machine humming, no Punishing Virus interfering. There was only absolute quiet.\nYou should check it out.	60012

You do remember it, right?\nThere's not much going on with Cerberus today, and you don't have any mission scheduled too. I checked.\nHow about watching an opera together? I've bought the tickets already. 5:30 in the evening.\nIt's not a very packed show. Maybe you can get me to spill some secrets you've been seeking?\nAnyway. We'll talk when you're there.	60013

Where the hell are you?\nSeat 9C and 9D. Enter from the left.\nTaking your time, aren't you? Do you need me to pick you up? You're a Chief. Be disciplined.\nForget it. Just in case—call me if something's wrong.\nI'll be waiting here before you do.

I was very glad when I received the mail.\nAs the captain of the Purifying Force, I am not supposed to show up in places like the shopping town unless required by a mission. But...\nI still wish to be selfish just for once on this special day.\nI will see you there tonight.\nP.S. Which Coating should I change into for tonight's occasion? Please let me know in your next mail.		
140	1	2023/11/21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/ItCharBirthday14.png	Bianca Activation Date Mail	Thank You For Today's Arrangement.	Bianca's Letter II	I didn't expect you to book the Holographic Theater and the restaurant in advance. The movie was great. I love the ending, especially that window with a view to the sea.\nEach time I go out with you like this, I feel very fulfilled. But storing such memories only in the memory module always feels a little insufficient...\nThat's why I would like to give this camera to you, Commandant.\nI originally wanted to use it to capture the fragments that I could have otherwise ignored, but when I saw you through its viewfinder, a thought suddenly came to my mind. What would I look like in your eyes?\nI was told that I could ask for something special on my Activation Day, so my wish is to let you use this camera to record the memories between us.\nSorry for the abrupt request, but it is truly my only wish today. This way, I can cherish those fragments of memories not only in my heart, but also in a photo album that I can keep.\nIt's getting late. You probably are about to rest when you receive this mail. I hope you can have that ocean-view window in your dream tonight.\nGood night, Commandant.	60014

Bambinata would like to thank you.\nMistress said Bambinata must not take others' things for granted, so if it is possible, would you care to come to the Egret lounge for afternoon tea? Bambinata is ordered to return to the lounge at 2:00 P.M. after completing the routine external module checkup, so it won't take up too much of your time... Mistress said there's still time for the restaurant to prepare one more serving, so please let Bambinata know if you are willing to come.\nBambinata would also like to give you something in return... Is that allowed? If you're not available today, Bambinata can place the gift at a designated location as you command.		
142	1	2023/12/5	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/ItCharBirthday15.png	Bambinata Activation Date Mail	About Your Apology, Commandant...	Bambinata's Letter II	Bambinata is very happy to have enjoyed an afternoon tea with Mistress and you, Commandant... You once said that "happy" is used to describe moments like this, didn't you?\nBut... why did you say sorry to Bambinata and Mistress?\nMistress answered your question regarding Bambinata's Activation Date during the afternoon tea. Since the exact date was unknown, Mistress put down the timestamp of the earliest fragment in Bambinata's memory data, the first time Bambinata had a comprehensive inspection at the Science Council. You said the beginning of memory was worth commemorating, but then you immediately stopped and apologized... Bambinata can't help but wonder if that has brought you any trouble.\nYou said that you didn't want Bambinata to feel uncomfortable about your language... but Bambinata won't feel uncomfortable about the memory loss as long as Mistress and you are around. B-but... Bambinata could forget your birthday without the memory data. Bambinata doesn't want to miss your birthday... After all, Mistress said that this was the first time someone celebrated Bambinata's Activation Date, so Bambinata has to celebrate yours! So Bambinata has prepared this gift as an early birthday present for you, Commandant... Hope you will like it.\nFrom what Bambinata can recall, you are also sometimes puzzled by things you don't remember. Bambinata has therefore prepared a container that can preserve memories... If you put your valuable treasures in there, they won't disappear with your memory data. Right, Bambinata has also carefully stored the gift from you, Commandant. Bambinata will guard these valuable treasures diligently.\nThank you once again.	60015	
143	1	2023/12/15	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	Ayla Activation Date Mail	[Push Notification] From Your Subscribed Account	Editor | Montpellier	An Exclusive Interview About the "Prismatic Trace" Exhibition | Ayla: Exploring All Colors in Each Other's Eyes (Abstract)\n\nDecember 15th, Babylonia News - "Prismatic Trace" made a stunning debut in section C-06 of the latest modern art exhibition. Created by Ayla, one of Babylonia's most renowned rising artists, this exhibition features captivating, diverse visual elements that present the experiences and encounters of different individuals in the Reconquista Age. It has been extremely well received, with the number of viewers reaching an all-time high over all the past exhibitions.\nOur reporter learned that all the works displayed in "Prismatic Trace" were completed by a joint effort between the WGAA and Task Force. Miss Ayla also agreed to an exclusive interview to share her ideas and experiences during the creation of this exhibition.\n\nQ: Can you share with us the reason for choosing this theme?\n\n"Art seems to have become a lot less significant in this era, which actually drives artists to think further... To me, this blue planet itself makes the vastest and most brilliant canvas. It has different colors in everyone's eyes: some see it as cheerfully bright, while others think it's gloomy and dim... That makes me want to portray the worlds in different people's eyes in various forms, because everyone can interpret 'reality' in distinct ways."\n\nQ: We feel that every piece of work displayed is highly impressive. There is even a "recreate" device next to each of them that allows the viewers to understand how they were created. Why did you choose this format?\n\n"It came from my recent experience during a battle on the surface. As for the recreate device... I want to give special thanks to a person who helped me a lot during the creation of this exhibition. That person is my muse, and while they may have not realized it, they have always been supporting me whenever I feel confused and lost. They have always been fighting for mankind's future, and I'd like to record their battle stories and portray the world in their eyes because their presence always brings us immense spiritual strength."\n\nQ: We have noticed that you named the empty canvas at the end of the exhibition "Masterpiece". Some say the name comes from the belief that your "most satisfied work" is always the next incomplete one. What do you think about that?\n\n"Haha... I like that interpretation! Personally, I take pride in every work that I put my heart into! Hmm... Actually, I just had an idea of what I should draw on that one, and I can't wait to make it happen!"\n\nQ: (Laughs) Is that what you call "Eureka"? Could you give us a little hint about your new work then? Not just me, I believe your fans are all curious about the true look of this "masterpiece" in your heart.\n\n"Well, at least for now, it's still a girl's secret! Besides... It does take a lot of courage..."		
144	1	2023/12/15	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/ItCharBirthday16.png	Ayla Activation Date Mail	From Ayla's Private Channel	Ayla's Letter	Hey, Commandant! It's been a few days. Are you missing me already?\nThanks for your Activation gift and cake. How can you always find out what I like?\nMy exhibition finally kicked off today. It means a lot to me... Because I finally get to observe and get in touch with the real, cruel world outside the shelter with a new perspective and mindset.\nI know you are always occupied with combat during the day, so I have applied to the WGAA to keep the exhibition for another day after it ends. On that day, you can take a good look at it with me as your personal guide! I also have a surprise for you and can't wait to hear your comment in person!\nMy works can never fully capture all the battles you have fought so far. Still, thanks to you and everyone else's effort, I am able to follow your trails to pick up all these forgotten stars and connect them together to make them known to more people.\nHehe... Did I sound too serious? Perhaps I haven't switched back from the exhibition mode. Anyway, I still have one last Activation Day wish, which is to draw the best portrait ever. Will you be my model and help me fulfill this wish?\nI know you would ask why would I keep drawing you after having done so many of your portraits already? Hmm... Maybe this is the only moment I can have you staring at me?\nHaha, just joking! Even for me, saying that feels a little too embarrassing...\nAnyway, just come over when you are free, alright? It's okay if you come a little late. I'll be waiting in the studio.\nLast but not least, I'd also like to share with you the cake you gave me.	60016	
145	1	2023/12/25	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/ItCharBirthday19.png	Rosetta Activation Date Mail	Our Most Recent Catch	Rosetta's Letter I	Commandant, here are some fish we caught from yesterday's fishing trip. Hope you will enjoy them.\nDon't worry about us. The Arctic Route Union has already got enough reserves to last the winter.\nAs a Forest Guard, we have to watch out for nearby Corrupted most of the time, so it's quite a rare experience to learn about fishing and go out to sea with you.\nI have walked through endless windy nights and watched the sun rise from the sea numerous times. Such views should be very familiar to me, but witnessing them with you and everyone else brings a completely different kind of joy.\nThere's something I didn't tell you when I invited you here... Today is my Activation Day.\nI never had many pleasant memories about this day when I was turned into a humanoid hybrid Construct, and I was used to not mention it to anyone.\nBut things are different now. I have returned to the crowd and had new memories. New Sophiasburgh is also being built... These things make me believe that dawn will eventually come to us after this long winter night.	60019

Would you like to stay overnight if there isn't anything urgent? Don't worry, I'll let Gray Raven know.\nYou helped us a lot. Other Forest Guards and the residents of ARU always wanted to thank you, but they were always short of supplies.\nFortunately, things are slowly getting better. We can have a good chat around the heater while enjoying freshly caught seafood, pine needle tea and berry cake made from Forest Guard's secret recipe... There's so much more we can do...\n...\nI'll talk to you when you arrive.\nI'll send you back to the camp after the blizzard stops.		
147	1	2023/12/31	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/ItCharBirthday20.png	Nanami's Letter	Ta-da! Activation Date Invite!	Nanami's Letter I	Today is the last day of this year, a perfect time to bid farewell to the past and usher in the start of a new year. Commandant, there's a place I want to show you. Do you have time?\nIt's not my Activation Date, but the Church of Machina's! Well, I don't mean the church is established today, but for you, the day you meet everyone is when your awareness of their existence is "activated". So, it should be fine to call it the Activation Date, I guess?\nI must be making things very confusing for you.\nI assure you, it's not as complicated as you think. I made many new friends and just want you to meet them.\nI want to introduce them all to you. You know, many of them gave nicknames to each other according to the tarot cards.\nI asked them why, and they told me it was the revelation of the Sagemachina. Then they showed me the graffiti I drew in the past...\nJust between you and me, it was completely on the spur of the moment. I added the tarot part to the graffiti because I had just finished watching "Mahou Shoujo Taroro" those days. Never expected to see this coming...\nBut I don't think anything is wrong with that, don't you agree?\nHumans have created many, many interesting works, and I want to keep them all in my heart.\nI'll save the rest and wait until you get here!	60020

If you get separated from other members, unexpected events may occur!\nKeep everyone in Gray Raven updated and prepare a backup communication plan to ensure stable contact anytime!\nI will stay here, hanging out with my new friends for a while, so there will be a long time before I can see you again.\nCommandant, be sure to take good care of yourself!

We are pleased to inform you of the below message:\nYour first visit to the Church of Machina has been successfully completed! You have visited 7 Strongholds and met 6 members in total.\nNext, kindly allow me to recommend you some other regions and members that you may be interested in. The recommendation is generated based on your preference I have learned so far, and the detailed information is made into a song and attached to this mail.\n(P.S. Dangerous individuals and regions have been excluded.)\nYou are always welcome to visit the Church of Machina again.	60021

I'd like to know your opinion about it.\nYou are always welcome to come back again.\nP.S. If you agree to grant me access to the schedule in your terminal, I will visit you during your free time.		
151	1	2024/1/3	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	Qu Activation Date Mail	Letter Received	Qu's Letter I	Received your letter. It's been a while.\nLiving in Tabula Akasha, it's hard to feel the passage of time. Had your recent letter not arrived, I wouldn't know the date. Occasional correspondence is a welcome respite.\nLately, while cataloging in the Ancient Archive, I've stumbled upon rare and valuable texts, mostly historical records and geographical compendiums. I often feel transported back to old Kowloong's scenic landscape—the beautiful mountains and tranquil waters.\nBut that scenery is, I suppose, lost to us now.\nIt's been long; you must have traveled a lot. Your stories and experiences are worth recording in Tabula Akasha. Remember, my invitation still stands.

I'm coming to meet you.\nBut the address you sent is gone from my terminal. It showed "cleared" when I checked, but I didn't clear it. Not sure what happened, but not my fault.\nI only remember you mentioning "Holo-Sight". So, where should I wait for you?\nAlso, the arcade—can we bring Buddy? Buddy wants to come, too.		
154	1	2024/1/21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/ItCharBirthday18.png	No. 21 Activation Date Mail	It's Fun	No. 21's Letter II	So humans also use this method to have their combat experiments. Oh, they seem to call these experiments "holographic games." My combat training involves defeating projected Corrupted—but no ducking around seaweed or taking down giant sharks. Is this what it feels like for fish underwater? Surrounded by all this blue—it's pretty cool.\nBut... is singing also part of human training? That "Immersive Stage" can do zero damage... No, wait, that song you sang did slow me down, made me want to sit and listen for a bit longer. But the song I'm good at, it doesn't come with music. Yeah, the one I sang on the beach during the summer. Since you said you liked it, I'll send you the CD.\n……\n……\n……\n……\n……\nThey wouldn't let Buddy into the arcade, even locked it up in a dark storage cabinet. Buddy was not pleased. When I went to pick it up, one of the humans said the storage had been damaged and that my guardian would have to compensate. What's a "guardian"? Anyway, I gave them your address.	60018	
155	2	2024/1/1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	2024 New Year Mail	It Starts Snowing Outside	Lucia	Commandant, are you on your break now? I'm en route to the lounge, and it has already started snowing outside. The Babylonia weather forecast said the artificial snowfall was scheduled to begin at 0:00 tonight, so I was surprised that it started two hours earlier.\n\nHave you ever heard the saying, "A timely snow promises a good harvest"? I came across it while researching historical documents regarding Kowloong. In the peaceful times on Earth, winter snowfall would blanket the soil, providing protection and ensuring robust crop growth when spring arrived. As I gaze out the window at the snowflakes now, it makes me wonder if this parallels our relationship with you.\n\nBefore truly getting to know you, I believed squads were formed based merely on tactical considerations, with commandants serving as risk controllers. However, you have revealed to me a realm far beyond battles and duties. In the past, I wielded my sword with a cold detachment, solely driven by the goal of reclaiming Earth. Yet now, with you and Gray Raven by my side, I have found a sense of belonging and warmth. My attachments to these newfound elements have honed my blade, becoming both my cherished treasure and the very motivation behind my fight.\n\nThe first day of the new year symbolizes a fresh start, and quite coincidentally, I noticed that you didn't schedule any work for today. I can't help but wonder about where you are and what you're doing. Are you currently outside? If you happen to have some free time, may I go meet you in person?\n\nBecause in this very moment, as I gaze upon the snow gracefully descending outside the window… all I yearn for is to stand by your side and embrace this new beginning together.		
156	2	2024/1/1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	2024 New Year Mail	Happy New Year, Commandant	Lee	Good morning, Commandant.\n\nYou should have just woken up by the time you read this email. However, considering your "secret operation" last night, I hope you didn't end up sleeping until the afternoon due to a lack of rest.\n\nThis morning, I stumbled upon two gifts near the maintenance chambers, each with a note—one addressed to me and the other to Murray. To tell you the truth, everyone in Gray Raven noticed how you secretly put up those paper-cut crafts in the lounge yesterday. We all pretended not to see, wanting to preserve the little surprise our "Commandant" had made an effort to arrange. I disabled the double-ended encryption on the electronic locks in my private lounge before I went to sleep last night, so it should have saved you some time cracking it.\n\nNow that I've discovered this surprise, you have my gratitude, and I thank you on behalf of Murray... I genuinely want you to know that your presence has been the best surprise, not just for me but for all of us in Gray Raven. In the coming year, all I wish for is your well-being and safety as you lead us forward. As for these kinds of "little surprises," I suggest picking a time that aligns better with your biological clock to do them rather than staying up until the early morning hours.\n\nBy the way, I heard that thanks to a particular member of the Engineering Force, Logistics issued a new regulation that strictly limits the number of explosives that can be assigned to each squad. So, congratulations, you don't have to worry about being summoned and questioned on the first morning of the new year. However, if you still want to experiment with those dangerous explosives... I got my hands on a few for display purposes that wouldn't attract the attention of the military court, given that I can't really stop those occasional wild thoughts of yours and that both Liv and Lucia love those fireworks.\n\nAnyway, it has been yet another year filled with numerous endeavors for Gray Raven, and without a doubt, we will persist in moving forward as a team in the year ahead.\n\nCommandant, Happy New Year.

Liv	Commandant, I hope you had a delightful breakfast today.\n\n...Actually, I discreetly placed the lucky coin I got last night on your plate. Did you happen to notice it? While Lucia and I were preparing the refreshments for our little gathering last night, I decided to hide a lucky coin in one of the snacks. It is said that finding such a coin brings blessings of happiness and joy for the entire year. I thought it would be a pleasant surprise for whoever discovered it, and surprisingly, I ended up being the one...\n\nBeing together with everyone in Gray Raven already makes me feel incredibly fortunate, so I'm wondering if you can help me by keeping this lucky coin safe.\n\nYou often remind me to lean on others instead of shouldering all burdens alone. So, perhaps you can consider this my first "selfish wish" in the new year. Please accept this lucky coin, and may it rid you of all hardships and help you achieve your desires. If any adversity occurs, I believe the united strength of Gray Raven will prevail. This is my New Year resolution—one that I wish to accomplish with all of you.\n\nBy the way, the weather has been exceptionally cold these days. I know the indoors are warmer, but please make sure to bundle up before venturing outside, won't you? (Consider this another one of my "selfish wishes," if you will.)\n\nCommandant, I'm certain that with you at our helm, Gray Raven will experience an even greater year ahead. You can always count on me to be by your side, ready to assist you whenever you need me.
158	1	2024/3/2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/ItCharBirthday22.png	Karenina Activation Date Mail	[Notice] Today's Plan...	Karenina's Letter I	Commandant, Teddy told me you submitted an application for spacewalking a few days ago. How strange... I never heard you had this interest? According to the protocol, those who have never spacewalked before must be accompanied by a senior... Alright, I'll reluctantly take this job since I'm usually in charge of the maintenance of Babylonia's outer wall. Nobody knows spacewalking better than me, so you are really lucky this time. D-do you understand? You must thank me afterward...\nSpeaking of which, I have made you this set of customized astronaut equipment. The standard suit would have all the necessary functions, but it's a product from over a decade ago after all. For you, I tailored a newest set using the Engineering Force's standards, and personally adjusted its gyroscope, calibration system and power unit. You can rest assured that it's the safest suit ever.\nBesides, I will also be there with you. Well, we only have half an hour left before departure. Don't forget to meet me in the preparation room!	60022	
159	1	2024/3/2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	Karenina Activation Date Mail	...Safety Protocols!	Karenina's Letter II	Phew... You did pretty well as a first-timer. Maybe you could become a famous astronaut or space engineer back in the Golden Age. Space walking is fun, isn't it? Being in space must feel a lot different from staying in Babylonia. I know some special views that can only be seen outside the space station, so come to me next time if you are interested.\nOh, I almost forgot to remind you—\nYou must always follow the safety protocol! Never say anything in the channel that is... unrelated to the mission! Especially that "Happy blahblah day!" Just never say it in official occasions!\nHave you remembered what I said?!\n\nP.S. This is Teddy. Before Captain could finish her message, her Inver-Device began to make noises as if it had overloaded. She is in the Science Council now trying to locate the problem. Well, at least we don't need to think of how to get her away.\nThanks for your card. The preparation of the surprise party is almost done. Bianca sent us a giant cake that probably can't be finished by the Engineering Force alone... So hurry up, you are the last one we are waiting for.		
160	1	2024/4/7	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/ItCharBirthday23.png	Changyu Activation Date Mail	Morning!	Changyu's Letter I	Morning, Commandant. You should be awake by now, right?\nWhat do you think of the offal stew yesterday? I could only find so many ingredients from the train, but I think it should taste pretty good.\nStill, my Activation Date is supposed to be today, and we should have noodles on this day according to Kowloong traditions, but it's a shame that I can't send you noodles. By the time they arrive, they would become soggy already. If only you didn't have missions today...\nAnyway, here are some buns I made this morning. I asked a transport team that I knew well to send them in an expedited delivery, so they would arrive just on time for your breakfast.\nP.S. Don't worry about the delivery fees. That guy owed me a big favor.	60023	
161	1	2024/4/7	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiFavoriteMailTag/UiFavoriteMailTagMail04.png	Changyu Activation Date Mail	Right! Don't Forget...	Changyu's Letter II	You haven't fulfilled your promise yet. Don't forget!\n"Sitting at a table together and tasting my dishes like a family." See, today is only the second half. Next time, we will finish the first half together.\nOf course, I will keep my promise too.\nLet's hang in there together for many more days to come!
