10101	Commandant, I'm here.	Talk_Idle	1500			About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10102	10105	10108
10102	Summer? I love the warm feeling... But I'll always have this warm feeling as long as I'm with everyone in Gray Raven. What about you, Commandant? Do you feel the same?		1500		10103	About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10102	10105	10108
10103	Feeling hot? Well... I think there are chilled watermelon and cold drinks over there. Liv should also have some things to cool you down. No, I can't do that. You would be frostbitten if I cool you off.		1500		10104	About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10102	10105	10108
10104	Whew... Maybe I can have some ice cream to cool down...		1500			About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10102	10105	10108
10105	There seems to be a grill over there. It's nice to have a barbecue in an outdoor vacation like this, right? But Liv told me to be careful with it... I wonder what she meant...		1500		10106	About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10102	10105	10108
10106	Commandant, not sure if you notice it. The footprints we left when we set foot on this island were washed away by the sea... But the sea will remember them, and so will I.		1500		10107	About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10102	10105	10108
10107	Have you got a plan for our holiday, Commandant?		1500			About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10102	10105	10108
10108	I'll be here for the time being, Commandant.	SummerNpc_Luxiya_Endtalk									
10201	Is there anything I can help with, Commandant?	Talk_Idle	1500			About the Island	About Liv	Goodbye	10202	10205	10208
10202	I had scanned the entire island before we landed. It's completely safe. The only hidden danger on this island is... that grill over there.		1500		10203	About the Island	About Liv	Goodbye	10202	10205	10208
10203	You also noticed the stage, Commandant? There are instruments on it. It's said that they were left for the visitors. Would you like to give them a try?		1500		10204	About the Island	About Liv	Goodbye	10202	10205	10208
10204	This island is warm enough even though it's isolated.		1500			About the Island	About Liv	Goodbye	10202	10205	10208
10205	Me? If I can, I would like to bring a coconut back and see if I can plant it. Not sure what kind of coconut tree it would grow into in the space... No, of course I won't plant it directly in our lounge.		1500		10206	About the Island	About Liv	Goodbye	10202	10205	10208
10206	I feel... secure. The wind, the sunshine, and the warm sand will always make me feel relaxed... Do you feel the same, Commandant?		1500		10207	About the Island	About Liv	Goodbye	10202	10205	10208
10207	I'll remember this holiday we spend together, Commandant.		1500			About the Island	About Liv	Goodbye	10202	10205	10208
10208	Goodbye, Commandant. I'll always be here.	SummerNpc_Lifu_Endtalk									
10301	Hi, Commandant.	Talk_Idle	1500			About Summer	About the Sea	Goodbye	10302	10305	10308
10302	In my memory, summer is always full of suffocating dust or a rain that won't stop for dozens of days. It's never this clear and bright. And most importantly, it's comfortable here.		1500		10303	About Summer	About the Sea	Goodbye	10302	10305	10308
10303	Have you watched the Summer Brawl before? It is an anime from the Golden Age. I think it's a perfect fit for this happy and relaxing time.		1500		10304	About Summer	About the Sea	Goodbye	10302	10305	10308
10304	I'm already very happy to be able to pass a peaceful summer.		1500			About Summer	About the Sea	Goodbye	10302	10305	10308
10305	Look! Is that a seagull? I only saw its illustration before, but I can still recognize it just like that. It must be wonderful to fly freely between the sky and the sea... This is, of course, one of my wishes as well.		1500		10306	About Summer	About the Sea	Goodbye	10302	10305	10308
10306	I actually had a horrible first impression on the sea, but now I finally get the chance to look at it quietly... What's on the other side of the sea?		1500		10307	About Summer	About the Sea	Goodbye	10302	10305	10308
10307	Go and have a look. What you see is what I want to see.		1500			About Summer	About the Sea	Goodbye	10302	10305	10308
10308	Goodbye, Commandant.	SummerNpc_Nuoan_Endtalk									
10401	Hmm... What's up, Commandant?	Talk_Idle	1500			About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10402	10405	10408
10402	Spring, summer, fall, and winter are all good seasons to take a sleep... Hmm? You feel the same?		1500		10403	About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10402	10405	10408
10403	Do you like this season? It is a sleepy season... Hmm? No, I don't want to go anywhere else. It's comfortable here. You go for me...		1500		10404	About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10402	10405	10408
10404	At least we have some great sunshine here, right?		1500			About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10402	10405	10408
10405	I checked the coastline, but today is the first time that I get to relax like this... What? We are on holiday? Then let me take a nap first...		1500		10406	About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10402	10405	10408
10406	Speaking of which, the beach chair is perfect to nap on, especially in the sea wind... Do you want to give it a go?		1500		10407	About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10402	10405	10408
10407	Hmm, Kamui has been asking me to play with him in the sea... What? You haven't seen him? Thank God...		1500			About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10402	10405	10408
10408	Good night... No, see you.	SummerNpc_Wanshi_Endtalk									
10501	Hello, Commandant.	Talk_Idle	1500			About the Sea	About Bianca	Goodbye	10502	10505	10508
10502	In my memory, the sea means more dangerous missions, but faith and purpose are like the rocks. They are unshakable...		1500		10503	About the Sea	About Bianca	Goodbye	10502	10505	10508
10503	How do you feel about the sea? It won't stay calm like this forever. It can be turbulent and terrifying... But will you still feel the same way you do when it's like that?		1500		10504	About the Sea	About Bianca	Goodbye	10502	10505	10508
10504	I miss the sea so bad.		1500			About the Sea	About Bianca	Goodbye	10502	10505	10508
10505	About the frames... Do you mind it? They are part of me, but I prefer to spend my holiday in a more relaxing way.		1500		10506	About the Sea	About Bianca	Goodbye	10502	10505	10508
10506	For the Purifying Force, the brief moment of standby is our holiday... What about the Task Force? You don't have much time off, do you? Commandant?		1500		10507	About the Sea	About Bianca	Goodbye	10502	10505	10508
10507	I'll be here watching, Commandant. Both the sea and you.		1500			About the Sea	About Bianca	Goodbye	10502	10505	10508
10508	See ya, Commandant.	SummerNpc_Bianka_Endtalk									
10601	Hey! Commandant! Nice to see you again!	Talk_Idle	1500			About Snacks	About the Sea	Goodbye	10602	10605	10608
10602	Commandant! There! Did you see the snack stand over there? Yeah, that thing called hamburger... Oh, it's fast food, right? It smells so good... I wonder how it tastes.		1500		10603	About Snacks	About the Sea	Goodbye	10602	10605	10608
10603	Kowloong has so many delicious foods in summer! The sweet soup, the bean jelly, the fruits, and the ice bowl. I've heard of the ice bowl, but I never had the chance to try it...		1500		10604	About Snacks	About the Sea	Goodbye	10602	10605	10608
10604	I've got to take you to try Kowloong's summer snacks if we have the time!		1500			About Snacks	About the Sea	Goodbye	10602	10605	10608
10605	I remember seeing the sea on the Nighter every day. Or the sea was all that I could see... Sounds confusing, doesn't it? Anyways, I love the sea here!		1500		10606	About Snacks	About the Sea	Goodbye	10602	10605	10608
10606	By the way, the stars in the night at sea are different from what we see in Babylonia. You haven't seen it before, right? Commandant? Let's look at the stars together at night!		1500		10607	About Snacks	About the Sea	Goodbye	10602	10605	10608
10607	Commandant, promise you'll take me when you go to the sea.		1500			About Snacks	About the Sea	Goodbye	10602	10605	10608
10608	Bye, Commandant.	SummerNpc_Pulao_Endtalk									
10701	Ha! There you are.	Talk_Idle	1500			About the Island	About Summer	Goodbye	10702	10705	10708
10702	My experience tells me that there are a few Corrupted hidden in that beach over there. And I wouldn't be surprised if some Ascendants suddenly come down from the sky... Yeah, that look. You don't need to suppress your nervousness. It's okay. I understand.		1500		10703	About the Island	About Summer	Goodbye	10702	10705	10708
10703	Commandant, get me a cold drink over there. You can get yourself one too. But don't get the wrong one. For the record, I have no experience in rescuing people who drink the cooling liquid by mistake.		1500		10704	About the Island	About Summer	Goodbye	10702	10705	10708
10704	The island is perfect for holiday. Plus, it's not boring here.		1500			About the Island	About Summer	Goodbye	10702	10705	10708
10705	When was the last time when the sea, the summer, and you were together? You should remember, right? Well... You'd better remember.		1500		10706	About the Island	About Summer	Goodbye	10702	10705	10708
10706	Sometimes I wonder if we should change our clothes, or coatings, according to the season. After all, summer is not a calm season, right?		1500		10707	About the Island	About Summer	Goodbye	10702	10705	10708
10707	You'll have to make some sacrifice if you want to share this shade with me... Think about it.		1500			About the Island	About Summer	Goodbye	10702	10705	10708
10708	Hmm? Are you leaving already?	SummerNpc_Weila_Endtalk									
10801	Hello, Conductor.	Talk_Idle	1500			About the Island	About the Stage	Goodbye	10802	10805	10808
10802	Only the smell of the sea can bring our souls back. I think you can feel it too, right? Conductor? The wind comes from the sea...		1500		10803	About the Island	About the Stage	Goodbye	10802	10805	10808
10803	Maybe we will only remember the summer we spent together when the horrible storm has passed and the sun casts its light on the ground.		1500		10804	About the Island	About the Stage	Goodbye	10802	10805	10808
10804	The storm has passed, so we can enjoy the sunshine on the island.		1500			About the Island	About the Stage	Goodbye	10802	10805	10808
10805	Yes, of course, we've all been on the stage and off the stage. I just miss this feeling. But these instruments... feel so strange.		1500		10806	About the Island	About the Stage	Goodbye	10802	10805	10808
10806	Would you like to hear something? Maybe I can play something for you. But most of the ball music can't be performed by one person... Would you like to join me, Conductor?		1500		10807	About the Island	About the Stage	Goodbye	10802	10805	10808
10807	A stage that I can't hide from. A stage that makes me stay.		1500			About the Island	About the Stage	Goodbye	10802	10805	10808
10808	Until then, Conductor.	SummerNpc_Sailinna_Endtalk									
10901	Hello, Commandant. Is there anything I can help with?	Talk_Idle	1500			About the Holiday	About Chrome	Goodbye	10902	10905	10908
10902	Speaking of which, we haven't made time to have some rest for a long time. "Rest and rejuvenate is also a tactic." I remember that's what the instructors told us in F.O.S.		1500		10903	About the Holiday	About Chrome	Goodbye	10902	10905	10908
10903	If the holiday lasts forever, then I'm afraid it will become just like work, right? This is exactly why this holiday is so precious.		1500		10904	About the Holiday	About Chrome	Goodbye	10902	10905	10908
10904	I'll be around anytime if you want some rest.		1500			About the Holiday	About Chrome	Goodbye	10902	10905	10908
10905	The unexpected holiday caught me off guard. I don't have any plans yet... What about you, Commandant? Any suggestions?		1500		10906	About the Holiday	About Chrome	Goodbye	10902	10905	10908
10906	...Oh, sorry, I was lost in thought. I didn't notice that you were calling me. Sometimes I would empty my mind like this when I have the time. It's a good way to relax. You should try, Commandant.		1500		10907	About the Holiday	About Chrome	Goodbye	10902	10905	10908
10907	Planning holidays for you and yourself is part of your duty as a commandant and captain.		1500			About the Holiday	About Chrome	Goodbye	10902	10905	10908

11001	What? Are you starting to enjoy the holiday?	Talk_Idle	1500			About the Island	About Lee	Goodbye	11002	11005	11008
11002	This is a nice place to take a holiday... Would you like to lie down a bit here? Just relax. You're having a holiday.		1500		11003	About the Island	About Lee	Goodbye	11002	11005	11008
11003	...I'm good, sitting here and enjoying the sea wind. If you want some food, there seem to be some snacks over there, but I'm not sure how it tastes.		1500		11004	About the Island	About Lee	Goodbye	11002	11005	11008
11004	I'm curious about where the stage gets its power. I bet it's not some mysterious summer power...		1500			About the Island	About Lee	Goodbye	11002	11005	11008
11005	Me? For me, it's not whether I like it or not. It's just that I feel calm staring at the sea. And it's a good time killer as well.		1500		11006	About the Island	About Lee	Goodbye	11002	11005	11008
11006	You are so strange. It's your holiday, but you're worrying about other people... I know. I'm fine. I can be better if you want.		1500		11007	About the Island	About Lee	Goodbye	11002	11005	11008
11007	You can take this holiday as our holiday, because that is what I think.		1500			About the Island	About Lee	Goodbye	11002	11005	11008

30001	Oh, you're here.	Stand_Idle	1500			About Celica	Goodbye		30002	30004	
30002	Why am I here, you ask? What if I said it's to oversee the United Command Bureau's work? What's your take?	Stand_Idle	1500	30003							
30003	—Relax, it may be called "supervision," but it's really just a friendly check-in.	Stand_Happy	1500			About Celica	Goodbye		30002	30004	
30004	I'll be sticking around, so no dodging me, okay?	CommonNpc_Sailika_Endtalk	1500								
30101	Happy New Year, Commandant.	Stand_Happy_Idle	1500			What are you doing here, Lucia?	Care to try some local delicacies?	Goodbye	30102	30107	30110
30102	Today marks the start of the New Year, a day we're supposed to relax. Liv and I swung by your quarters this morning, but you were already out.	Stand_Idle	1500	30103							
30103	Lee figured you'd either be networking with fellow commandants at the Bureau or honing your skills at the range. Having checked the range, I thought I'd drop by here to check.	Think_Idle	1500	30104							
30104	Nothing urgent. Tonight, Liv, Lee, and I plan to review Gray Raven's yearly changes. Naturally, you're essential, Commandant.	Stand_Idle	1500	30105							
30105	It's not about discussing tactics. It's a rare chance for Gray Raven folks to chill and chat. Liv and I will prep some snacks ahead of time.	Stand_Idle	1500	30106							
30106	I could've messaged you via the terminal, but inviting you in person seems more... ceremonial? Anyway, look forward to it, Commandant.	Stand_Happy	1500			What are you doing here, Lucia?	Care to try some local delicacies?	Goodbye	30102	30107	30110
30107	Thanks, Commandant, but no need. I'm just a bit curious about the recipes. Wish I could take some cooking lessons if I get the chance.	No_Happy	1500	30108							
30108	Recently, I realized that more seasoning doesn't necessarily make a dish tastier. But putting that insight into practice is gonna take more work.	Think_Idle	1500	30109							
30109	When I get confident in my cooking, you'll be the first to taste it, Commandant. I promise.	Stand_Happy	1500			What are you doing here, Lucia?	Care to try some local delicacies?	Goodbye	30102	30106	30110
30110	Alright, Commandant, you carry on.	SpringNpc_Luxiya_Endtalk									
30201	...Happy New Year.	Stand_Idle	1500			Fancy kite-making?	A rare break...	Goodbye	30202	30206	30210
30202	I tried kite-making as a kid. Although I managed to create one, Murray wasn't free to play outside like other kids.	Think_Close	1500	30203							
30203	Seeing all these materials and samples here kinda makes me nostalgic.	Think_Close	1500	30204							
30204	...You're thinking of giving it a shot? I'm game, but the weather Babylonia has been snowy lately. Not exactly ideal for kite-flying.	Think_Idle	1500	30205							
30205	Good point. There's no rush. And it's not like we'll nail it on our first try. But I'll stick with you until we get it just right.	Stand_Idle	1500			Fancy kite-making?	A rare break...	Goodbye	30202	30206	30210
30206	Yes, it's my day off, so I'm just wandering about. Don't get it twisted, I didn't come here just to find you.	Stand_Idle	1500	30207							
30207	Chatted with Murray this morning. On my way back to the lounge, I thought of someone who's all work and no play, so I decided to swing by.	Stand_Idle	1500	30208							
30208	Knew I'd find you here. I mean, you remind everyone else to take a break today, but here you are.	Think_Close	1500	30209							
30209	...Just out for a walk...? Let's assume you're being honest.	Think_Idle	1500			Fancy kite-making?	A rare break...	Goodbye	30202	30206	30210
30210	Yeah.	SpringNpc_Li_Endtalk									
30301	Seen the first snow of the new year yet, Commandant?	Talk_Happy	1500			Happy New Year, Liv.	How's today looking for you, Liv?	Goodbye	30302	30307	30310
30302	Happy New Year, Commandant. Oh, I should've been the one to say it first...	Stand_Happy_Idle	1500	30303							
30303	Commandant, you can't be frowning right from the start of the year. Even at the squad's late-night get-togethers recently...	No_Happy	1500	30304							
30304	I'm aware you're juggling a lot, Commandant. But remember what Lucia said? As long as we stick together, there's nothing we can't overcome.	Stand_Idle	1500	30305							
30305	If things get too much to handle, feel free to lean on me more. I'm set on being more reliable this year.	Stand_Idle	1500	30306							
30306	That's the smile we're all hoping to see. Keeping you at ease is everyone's unspoken hope.	Stand_Happy	1500			Happy New Year, Liv.	How's today looking for you, Liv?	Goodbye	30302	30307	30310
30307	Oops, hit a button on the device by mistake. Did you catch that, Commandant? Silly me...	Think_Cry	1500	30308							
30308	The slip says "fair luck". Good for a big cleanup, bad for... wanting it all. Guess it's true, greed gets you nowhere.	Stand_Idle	1500	30309							
30309	So today, from now on, Liv will just focus on what's in front of her—the snowscape and everyone around.	Stand_Happy	1500			Happy New Year, Liv.	How's today looking for you, Liv?	Goodbye	30302	30307	30310
30310	Alright, Commandant, see you later.	SpringNpc_Lifu_Endtalk									
30401	...Why do you look so surprised?	Stand_Idle	1500			What are you doing here?!	I never pegged you as someone into bamboo gazing.	Goodbye	30402	30407	30410
30402	Isn't New Year's the perfect time for connecting with loved ones in your book?	Think_Idle	1500	30403							
30403	Or did I get you all wrong, and you're not expecting any of this at all?	Stand_Idle	1500	30404							
30404	Relax, I've got my power under control for now. No plans to sink this human ark today.	Stand_Idle	1500	30405							
30405	...A scarf? Had nothing ready, so this is your New Year's gift? I didn't come to ask for anything, you know.	Think_Idle	1500	30406							
30406	But... even if you have your choices and I have my mine, I still cherish the freedom to occasionally defy fate.	Stand_Idle	1500			What are you doing here?!	I never pegged you as someone into bamboo gazing.	Goodbye	30402	30407	30410
30407	No. It's just everything here has this "enhanced" feel to it. The plants, the weather... they're different from what you'd find on the surface.	Think_Idle	1500	30408							
30408	Try to remember how they feel. Next time, maybe during a snowfall, if I come across a bamboo grove, I'll bring you along.	Stand_Idle	1500	30409							
30409	Then you'll see what I mean by "different."	Stand_Idle	1500			What are you doing here?!	I never pegged you as someone into bamboo gazing.	Goodbye	30402	30407	30410
30410	You head off. When I need to find you, I know how to track you down.	SpringNpc_LuxiyaR3_Endtalk									
30501	Good day, Commandant—and a Happy New Year to you.	Talk_Happy	1500			Interested in fireworks?	Keeping busy during these holidays?	Goodbye	30502	30506	30509
30502	Karenina used to have me test some of her explosive inventions. One was pretty much like fireworks.	Think_Idle	1500	30503							
30503	It's not ground-fired, though. Karenina launches them, then I trigger them with my arrows.	Stand_Idle	1500	30504							
30504	In order to observe the range, Karenina added bright-colored powder. Although it's for weapon testing, gotta admit, the blasts are as beautiful as fireworks.	Stand_Happy	1500	30505							
30505	If you're interested, Commandant, I can recreate that colorful blaze with my arrows, festival or not. Of course, I'll ask Karenina to keep it within the spectacle range.	Stand_Idle	1500			Interested in fireworks?	Keeping busy during these holidays?	Goodbye	30502	30506	30509
30506	As the captain of the Purifying Force, I need to be on standby for duty. But there haven't been any assignments lately, so it's kinda like downtime.	Think_Idle	1500	30507							
30507	But in my spare time, I do some praying. After all, it's a time of renewal, right?	Stand_Idle	1500	30508							
30508	Plus, with Babylonia scheduled for snowfall these days, the snowy scenery itself brings back memories worth a prayer or two.	Stand_Happy	1500			Interested in fireworks?	Keeping busy during these holidays?	Goodbye	30502	30506	30509
30509	See you, Commandant.	SpringNpc_Bianka_Endtalk	1500								
30601	Ah, Commandant! Happy New Year!	Greet_Happy	1500			What's Pulao scribbling over there?	Are you not taking the day off	Goodbye	30602	30606	30610
30602	Oh, this? I was just... sketching something for fun!	Shy_Idle	1500	30603							
30603	It's definitely not because it's too messy to show!	Refuse_Concentrate	1500	30604							
30604	Ugh, you saw... Actually, I found some ink and thought I'd show off my calligraphy...	Think_Cry	1500	30605							
30605	Who knew Calligraphy was as tough as math... I've gotta practice more when I get back. If it goes well, maybe I'll gift you a handwritten couplet next year!	Think_Cry	1500			What's Pulao scribbling over there?	Are you not taking the day off	Goodbye	30602	30606	30610
30606	Vacation? Absolutely! Kowloong is buzzing during these special festival days. The streets are brimming with delicious treats and fun activities!	Victory_Happy2	1500	30607							
30607	Me? I've got to be responsible during working hours! Besides, the overtime pay during the festival...	Think_Drool	1500	30608							
30608	Ahem, in any case, I need to focus on my work so everyone in Kowloong can enjoy the holiday. I won't lose sight of that!	Stand_Idle	1500	30609							
30609	Hey, the festivities in Kowloong aren't over yet. If you've got some time, Commandant, how about joining me for a trip there?	Stand_Happy	1500			What's Pulao scribbling over there?	Are you not taking the day off	Goodbye	30602	30606	30610
30610	You carry on, Commandant.	SpringNpc_Pulao_Endtalk									
30701	Oh?	Stand_Idle	1500			Craving some tanghulu?	Happy New Year!	Goodbye	30702	30706	30709
30702	I just figured it'd be a local delicacy worth bringing along when I report back to Jamilah.	Think_Close	1500	30703							
30703	Depending on the train's region and season, local festive items like these really catch on.	Stand_Idle	1500	30704							
30704	Let me have a taste before deciding? Fair point.	Stand_Idle	1500	30705							
30705	...Hmm, so sweet.	Stand_Happy_Idle	1500			Craving some tanghulu?	Happy New Year!	Goodbye	30702	30706	30709
30706	...Happy New Year. What's the proper etiquette for this moment, by Kowloong tradition?	Stand_Idle	1500	30707							
30707	Just enjoy the vibe, huh? Got it.	Think_Idle	1500	30708							
30708	Next time you visit the Akdilek Commercial Alliance, I'll treat you to a special vibe. Consider it a return gift, no, an invitation.	Stand_Idle	1500			Craving some tanghulu?	Happy New Year!	Goodbye	30702	30706	30709
30709	That's about it.	SpringNpc_Sufeiya_Endtalk	1500
