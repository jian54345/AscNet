But if that was the case, why is the food not double-spicy the way Camu likes?

4012	Moon Rock	An item Luna sent along with the Activation Date mail. Will be archived in Commandant's secret space.	An unpolished rock the size of a palm. Based on Luna's letter, this rock comes from the surface of the Moon.

Even if she has forgotten their origins when she sees them again, she never doubts their significance as long as they are in that box. Some memories last longer, while some are quickly forgotten. Bambinata gave you this container that she used to fight forgetfulness, in the hope that you can preserve as many important memories as possible.

80003	Firecrackers	Spring Festival — Cannon	Its design is inspired by firecrackers. The firecrackers on the tail can be loaded into the barrel as a projectile.

80005	Caldwell - 49	Oathbound — Levi-Gun	This Levi-Gun was named after a rose in a far-off galaxy. The universe was dubbed the "ultimate romance" during the Golden Age. Of course, converting the romantic value into damage is far more gratifying. Whether it is the aesthetic or the damage rate, it is nearly flawless, except that it demands the user to have a superb aiming skill.

80006	White Acclaim	Oathbound — Bow	As the name suggests, this is a ceremonial rather than a practical weapon. Instead of a raging battlefield, it belongs in a sacred or peaceful setting.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconToolsSp/E3BowMd100011Sp.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/E3BowMd100011.png	32	5	2100	1	1												0							12040002

80008	Star of Bethlehem	Christmas — Greatsword	A greatsword that resembles a Christmas tree. The Star of Bethlehem is stuck tightly on the tip, so tight that not even a fierce swing can shake it off. The blade is not sharp, but its bulk makes it a deadly weapon.

80009	Starry Clouds	Spring Festival — Uniframe Glaive	The stars have been witnessing mankind for an eternity. The human history is like ever-changing clouds. The patterns on the heavy glaive are delicate and give an antique feel. According to the Kowloong history, this glaive was once given to its owner as a gift. There is a small "Yuan" signed at the end of the letter found in the package.

80010	Lupercalia	Affection — Katana	Brings the power of the faun's blade to life using modern technology. Inside this chocolate box is the name of your destined one. The ancient reign is long gone, but this bizarre tradition still exists. Come, find your fate in this box. You have unlimited time.

80011	Yggdrasil	Legend — Spear Shield	As the hero protects this world, the sacred world tree comes to its guardian's aid. Taking a branch from Yggdrasil, the hero turns it into the eternal divine spear—a deadly weapon, as well as a living part of Yggdrasil.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconToolsSp/E3SpearMd030011Sp.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/E3SpearMd030011.png	32	5	2100	1	1												0							12110001							
80012	Lion Glory	Yesterday Once More — Gunblade	Lion Glory is the name of the weapon equipped by outstanding F.O.S. graduates. Its name originates from the lion-like deep roar when it is swung. Lions are not easily tamed, and Lion's Glory is not lightly given out. Holders need to discipline themselves and engrave their hopes on their chests to be worthy of the glory of the lion's soul.

80014	Shadowforged — Dying Light	Festival — Katana	With only traces of material applied in a special coating process, this blade has a crimson glow like a setting sun. It has no real impact on the weapon's performance, but somehow it gives an impression that the blade is sharper under the effect of this amazing color.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconToolsSp/E3SwordMd080012Sp.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/E3SwordMd080012.png	32	5	2100	1	1												0							12020003							
80015	Open Annulus	New Life — Amplifier	The internal transmission loop of Open Annulus is complex and esoteric because of its avant-garde notch design. Once considered to prioritize form over function, its immense computing power has silenced its naysayers as its processing power reaches new heights from its breakthrough innovation.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconToolsSp/E3RingMd030011Sp.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/E3RingMd030011.png	32	5	2100	1	1												0	80020						12170002							
80016	Platinum Swan	Advanced Production — Levi-Gun	Just like how people tend to ignore the aggressiveness of swans for their gorgeous looks, the elegant and slender shape of this Levi-Gun often makes others forget the fact that it is a weapon used by Task Force Constructs.

80017	Bonescale Blade	Ocean Secret — Katana	Do you really think mermaids have no means to protect themselves? They forge their scales into a mail and bones into a blade to defend their bodies, minds, and their important ones behind.

Don't nitpick the details, c'mon! —NA-NA-MI, having gone full shark mode	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconToolsSp/E3SawMd110011Sp.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/E3SawMd110011.png	32	5	2100	1	1												0							12050001							
80019	Moonlight Fantasia	Festivals — Uniframe Cello Blade	Away from the familiar roads and into the mysterious night. Close your eyes and let the silent music of the night flow, soft and bright. This may not be the home you yearn for, nor the end of your journey. Even so, rest my little traveler, just for a while and lose yourself in this symphony of lights.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconToolsSp/E3CelloMd020011Sp.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/E3CelloMd020011.png	32	5	2100	1	1												0							12190001							
80020	Firmament	Wandering Ballad — Scepter	In the vast cold sky, this is the only thing that never leaves the deity's side. What is she waiting and wishing for? It seems that only the ones who can reach her will know the truth.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconToolsSp/E3WandMd020011Sp.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/E3WandMd020011.png	32	5	2100	1	1												0	80033						12240001

80022	Gray Moon Embrace	Paradise Lost — Gunblade	A weapon that cuts through the red tide as if desiring to drink all the blood of its enemies. As long as its hilt is gripped tightly, its wielder will have an endless impulse to keep moving forward no matter what has happened. But is this an eternal curse or a voluntary choice of its wielder?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconToolsSp/E3GunbladeMd030011Sp.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/E3GunbladeMd030011.png	32	5	2100	1	1												0	80039						12200002							
80023	Oceanic Assault	Ocean Secret — Greatsword	A sword that uses a massive amount of soft filling material to cope with impact beyond the limit. Its unique design also makes it look more like a cushion than a weapon. Although the cold light reflected by the blade (the fin) makes most people drop the idea of holding it while sleeping, the fish's eyes are surprisingly mesmerizing. Even the designer ended up falling victim to it.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconToolsSp/E3ClaymoreMd100011Sp.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/E3ClaymoreMd100011.png	32	5	2100	1	1												0	80041						12060003							
80024	Flame Beast	Operation Zero — Cannon	Although the user always complains that the designer misunderstood their requirements and that they want a feline beast who devours food, not a cute beast who holds a knife and fork, the user has never raised the appeal or asked for adjustment.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconToolsSp/E3SleeveMd100011Sp.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/E3SleeveMd100011.png	32	5	2100	1	1												0	80045						12070003							
80025	Birth at Silent Night	New Life — Uniframe Glaive	A loyal white dog builds the path between life and death. An elegant black cat chases away the evil serpent. She wields the scepter in her hand and prays for all her people to have hope in life.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconToolsSp/E3QuMd030011Sp.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/E3QuMd030011.png	32	5	2100	1	1												0	80042						12130002							
80026	Nightflyer	Spring Festival — Bow	A bow that follows the style of a traditional hunting bow both in terms of design and crafting techniques. Its black gold body and faintly glowing red dots on it can always make one think of a hunter in an ambush. Preys will always fall at the sound of the bowstring.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconToolsSp/E3BowMd110011Sp.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/E3BowMd110011.png	32	5	2100	1	1												0	80048	80049					12040003							
80027	Shadow Blade	Spring Festival — Greatsword	A greatsword featuring a low-key dark color scheme to highlight the durability of its material. However, its user commented, "The color is too dull. It needs something vibrant." Therefore, a red ribbon was added to the sword. Besides, the ribbon is surprisingly suitable for the festival that we are celebrating.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconToolsSp/E3ClaymoreMd110011Sp.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/E3ClaymoreMd110011.png	32	5	2100	1	1												0	80048						12060004							
80028	Spring's Rising	Spring Festival — Scepter	Set off the firecrackers to chase away the evil and welcome the spring.

80029	Black Sheep	New Life — Dual Guns	If we only see ourselves through the lens of our mistakes, we may naturally label ourselves as "black sheep." However, no one is eternally trapped in the past. A fired bullet will be set on a new target, and even the "weapon" will regain its true colors.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconToolsSp/E3GunMd120011Sp.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/E3GunMd120011.png	32	5	2100	1	1												0	80051						12010001							
80030	Blue Slumber	Yesterday Once More — Uniframe Chain Blade	A dreamy blue rose blooms in the palm of the knight's hand. There he stands, on the shore far across the distance, praying for the dream world to extend and the pedals to crush the confusion and lead a way for an encounter. Even if the connection is bound to be made with thorns, and despite the suffering and the pain, he will never let it go until death.

80031	Shining Banner	New Life — Banner Spear	A flag embodies willpower and ideals. Its design is simple, but the spirit of solidarity it carries can truly reach the hearts of anyone.

80032	Red Blossom	New Life — Uniframe Dragon Axe	The girl on the stage nervously holds her hands before her chest, while the audience eagerly anticipates hearing her singing. She makes up her mind and draws an arc with two fingers. Just when the audience is about to imitate her gesture, a red, sharp blade appears and starts dancing in sync with the girl. After a short silence, the audience bursts into cheers—Being good at singing is not the only standard for the new generation of idols.

80033	Dragonboat	Dragon Boat Festival — Uniframe Greatsword	A greatsword created with the theme of an ancient Dragon Boat Festival celebration ceremony. A tester complains that a sword with this design can only be an exhibit and then raises the sword, which immediately breaks the wall of the testing room.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconToolsSp/E3KamuMd030011Sp.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/E3KamuMd030011.png	32	5	2100	1	1												0							12100001							
80034	Theros' Bloom	Beats & Beach — Banner Spear	In order to protect the maiden from the scorching light, its panels open as if a flower blooms, occupying a space exclusively for her. Maintaining a low profile, the maiden looks for something that can arouse her interest along with the flow of music, until a person meets her gaze and instantly turns away. The maiden knows it is time to use its another function. She folds the panels down and hurls it like a javelin. It pierces into the ground right before the commandant.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconToolsSp/E3LanceMd030011Sp.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/E3LanceMd030011.png	32	5	2100	1	1												0	80065						12230002							
80035	Titania	Wandering Ballad — Scepter	Butterfly wings carry dreams and give off a jade-colored luminescence. As long as the traces of memory do not fade, the light of the scepter will not grow dim, and the magic of realizing dreams will last forever.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconToolsSp/E3WandMd040011Sp.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/E3WandMd040011.png	32	5	2100	1	1												0	80063						12240003

80037	Soaker Mk.81 Redux	True Blue — Gun Set	Soaker Mk.81 was originally just a toy sold by a certain 13th consortium during the Golden Age. It is surprising that it can really be used as a weapon after Wanshi's thorough modification. Equipped with Wanshi's customized energy can filled with mint-flavored gas, it can refresh the minds of its user and the target hit when it fires. It also retains a function that a toy should have. By reducing its power output, its user can blow away sleepiness with pleasantly cool winds.

80040	Elpis, Release!	Fantasy Harmony — Bow	Carrying the purest dream of the girl, the pink bow spreads its wings to shoot the arrow infused with passion and hope to the darkness before dawn. When the dawn breaks, the girl travels in the sound of discussion and sees the familiar figure. She secretly pulls the pink bowstring that not only contains the power to destroy evil but also Cupid's magic.
